letter 's' followed by your student number) and password.\nForgotten your password? Reset it\n.\nCan't see your course in Canvas?\nCourses should appear in Canvas seven days before the official course start date. If your course has already started, it will appear in Canvas 24 hours after you add it in\nEnrolment Online\n.\nIf you have further questions, contact your Course Coordinator.\nLight mode on Canvas – accessible recommendation for students\nYou may have noticed that Canvas recently introduced dark mode on the mobile version of the app.\nWhile the mode is still being tested and refined, there may be elements of the app that are harder to read and see in dark mode.\nIf you’re having trouble with using dark mode on the mobile app, you can change it back to light mode by following\nthese instructions (PDF, 21MB).\nWhat is Canvas?\nCanvas is RMIT's online Learning Management System (LMS), where you can find all of your course announcements and content, including class notes and resources. On Canvas you can listen to lectures, complete online assessment tasks, view and submit assignments, and receive grades and feedback.\nCanvas Explainer for Students\nStudents explain what Canvas is, how to navigate the interface, find course materials, submit assignments and more.\nCanvas Explainer for Students\nStudents explain what Canvas is, how to navigate the interface, find course materials, submit assignments and more.\nTranscript\n[Start transcript]\n[Music]\n[Nhuan Pham]\nHi, my name is Nhuan and I’m a student here at RMIT studying a Bachelor of Art.\nToday, I’m here to walk you through how to log in and navigate Canvas, RMIT’s Learning Management System.\nThe first thing you will need to do is open up your preferred web browser. Visit RMIT’s website, which is www.rmit.edu.au. Select the student link at the top of your screen in the navigation bar.\n[Music continues]\nOnce you click on the Canvas link, you will be redirected to a login portal to access your personal RMIT section of the website. Login using your student number and password. When you are ready, click login.\nThe dashboard is the first think you will see when you log in to Canvas. The dashboard helps you see what is happening in all of your current courses. On the right side, you will see any work you need to complete, feedback, grades you have received and any upcoming events.\nThe global navigation menu is located on the left side of every page in Canvas. The global navigation links provide quick access to frequently used Canvas features. You can return to your dashboard at any time by clicking the dashboard link in the global navigation.\nThe first link in the global navigation is where you will find your Canvas account settings. In here, you can upload your profile picture and adjust your notification preferences. Canvas allows you to customise how you receive notifications from all of your courses. You can add different contact methods to receive notifications. So, it’s just announcements and grades to your mobile number, the Canvas app or an alternative email address.\nIt’s important that you spend time reviewing your notifications. And, in particular, make sure you have announcements turned on. This ensures you receive any information from your teachers straight away. For more information on setting up your notifications, see the links to the guide below the video.\nWhen you are ready, select your dashboard, and then click into the course you want to view. First is your homepage, which will be the first think you seen in your course. Next up, you’ll have announcements which will have any messages from your teachers. After that it’s your course syllabus. This contains the course summary, including topics, readings and assessment dates.\nIn a course, all your learning materials will be located in modules. Each module can contain files, discussions, assignments and other resources. You can select modules from the course navigation. And once you are there, you will be able to see a welcome module with introduction information and course resources organised according to the course delivery.\nIn Canvas, all your assessments information can be found in the assignment link. By clicking on the link, you get a list of all your assessment tasks for the course. When you click on the name of an assessment, it will display all information from the teachers about the task, including the due date and the rubric. It will also allow you to submit your assessment when the time comes. And finally, this is where you will be able to see your grades and view your feedback.\nIf you ever run into any trouble, you can always reach out to Canvas support. They are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. You can find all your help options in the help link in the Canvas global navigation. Plus, you can always speak to your teacher.\nCanvas also has a student app, which you can download for free from the App Store. Canvas mobile apps for iOS and android gives you access to your course whenever you need it and wherever you are. You’ll see the dashboard where you can access information in each of your courses and information about any groups that you are in.\nUsing the menu at the bottom of the screen, you can access your dashboard, calendar, task list, notifications and inbox. The app is really easy to use, and it means you can get updates, announcements and notifications instantly. You can participate in discussions when you are out and about. And it’s a great way to get all your reading done on the train. You can also access all of your assignments easily and view the calendar or task list to check what assignments are due soon.\nGood luck and welcome to Canvas.\n[Music continues]\n[End transcript]\nBack to video\nGet set up on Canvas\nIf you’re a new student, there are some simple things you should do to get set up on Canvas.\nExpand all sections\nSet up your notifications\nCanvas notifications can be personalised based on your individual preferences.

You can change your notification settings at any time. It is each student’s responsibility to ensure the settings are appropriate for their course.\nMake sure all your courses are appearing in Canvas\nCourses should appear in Canvas seven days before the official course start date. If your course has already started, it will appear in Canvas 24 hours after you add it in Enrolment Online.\nIf you can’t see your course on your Canvas dashboard, click on\nCourses\nin the navigation panel to the left of your dashboard. Scroll down and select\nAll courses\nat the bottom. If your missing course is in the\nAll courses\nlist, click on the\nstar symbol\nnext to it to make it appear on the dashboard.\nIf you still can’t see your course, this might be because it's still being prepared. Your teachers have been working hard to get your course content ready. It’s a big process, so we are being careful to make sure we get it right, but rest assured, they’ll be up there soon.\nIf you have any concerns about your course not being on Canvas, then please contact your teacher/Course Coordinator.\nIf you need technical support, there is a 24/7 live chat function available in the navigation bar under\nHelp > Canvas Support\non your Canvas dashboard.\nFill out your profile\nAdd an image and fill out your profile so that teachers and other students can quickly identify you in course discussions.\nYou can also check your ‘Display name’ in Canvas (under ‘Settings’) reflects your preferred name and update this if desired.

Familiarise yourself with your assignments and when they’re due.\nPlease note: normally, you can submit your assignment an unlimited number of times up to the due date (there will be a 24-hour delay if you resubmit more than three times). However, your instructor may choose to limit the number of times you can submit an assignment. Limiting the number of submissions applies to all students who must complete the assignment.\nDownload the Canvas app\nDownload the Canvas Student app via the\nApp Store\nor\nGoogle Play Store\nfor mobile devices and allow notifications. This is important as teachers may communicate room changes to you through Canvas announcements.\nSubmitting assignments in Canvas using Turnitin\nTurnitin is part of RMIT’s online assignment submission process used within Canvas.\nTurnitin promotes\nacademic integrity\n– the demonstration of integrity, honesty and fairness in your scholarly activities – by checking that your assignments are your own work and that you have acknowledged the work and ideas used from other sources.\nRMIT may use tools to detect the use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools in assessments where AI tools are not permitted.\nExpand all sections\nSubmission requirements\nTurnitin will accept the following file types:\nMicrosoft Word (.doc/.docx)\nOpenOffice (.odt)\nGoogle Docs via Google Drive\nWordPerfect (.wpd)\nPostScript (.ps/.eps)\nAdobe PDF (.pdf)\nRich text format (.rtf)\nPlain text (.txt)\nHangul Word Processor file (.hwp)\nHTML\nFiles can be submitted directly from your computer or via non-RMIT Google Drive or Dropbox accounts.

The report shows where matches have been found with an overall percentage of how much of the text is original. Your submitted assignment is also added to the database to reduce plagiarism.\nIf your teacher has provided access for you to view the Similarity Report, you can view your assignment's 'similarity score' from the\nView/Complete link\nfor the assignment.

What's a testamur? Here are some common graduation terms and what they mean.\nTestamur:\nThe graduation certificate higher education students receive when they graduate. For more information, see\nTypes of academic statements and how to get them\n.\nVE Qualification Statement:\nThe graduation certificate vocational education students receive when they graduate. For more information, see\nTypes of academic statements and how to get them\n.\nGraduation gown/Academic dress:\nThe regalia worn when graduating at a ceremony.For more information, see\nGraduation dress\n.\nProgram completion:\nThis is when you have met the academic requirements of your program of study and are marked as having completed your program on RMIT systems. Normally, your completion date occurs\nup to two weeks after your\nresults are released\nfor the last semester of your program\n. It is not the same as your graduation date.\nPlease note, you cannot access or order some academic statements (including SACs and finalised transcripts) until\nafter\nyour program completion. For more information, see\nTypes of academic statements and how to get them\n.\nConferral:\nAlso called Graduation. The date your qualification is awarded and you graduate at a ceremony or in absentia.\nIn absentia:\nGraduating in absentia means you don’t receive your graduation certificate at a ceremony. In absentia conferrals are usually the last working day of the month. You can then access your academic statements (including your Testamur or VE Qualification Statement) online and order a hardcopy to be posted to you.\nDeferring your graduation:\nPostpone your graduation by applying to graduate at a later ceremony.\nAward level:\nWhen you graduate, your award may be conferred with an\naward level\n(e.g. 'Distinction' or 'Honours First Class'). Depending on your program, your award level will be calculated based on your\nGPA\n,\nWAM\nor, for HDR students, the mark achieved in your research project. Vocational education programs and doctoral programs are awarded without an award level.\nNeed help?\nIf you have a question about your graduation, please contact the Graduation team via\nStudent Connect\n.\nRelated links\nApply to graduate\nMelbourne Graduation Ceremony\nMelbourne Graduation Parade\nRMIT graduation ceremonies\nGraduation dress\nAcademic transcripts and statements\nAward levels\nAward verification service (for employers and institutions)\nCareer and development events\nRMIT Alumni\nRelated links\nApply to graduate\nMelbourne Graduation Ceremony\nMelbourne Graduation Parade\nRMIT graduation ceremonies\nGraduation dress\nAcademic transcripts and statements\nAward levels\nAward verification service (for employers and institutions)\nCareer and development events\nRMIT Alumni\nAcknowledgement of Country\nRMIT University acknowledges the people of the Woi wurrung and Boon wurrung language groups of the eastern Kulin Nation on whose unceded lands we conduct the business of the University.

The smoke cleanses the area of evil spirits. The leaves have swirling lines showing that they are still green and their oils still present, promoting more smoke.\nThe central section of the work is the smoke 'spirit' that all people must pass through to be cleansed.\nThe background is symbolic of the glow of fires from the camp. The fire’s warmth and light is comforting for visitors.\nAcknowledgement of Country\nRMIT University acknowledges the people of the Woi wurrung and Boon wurrung language groups of the eastern Kulin Nation on whose unceded lands we conduct the business of the University. RMIT University respectfully acknowledges their Ancestors and Elders, past and present.

We are committed to offering inclusive, respectful, and safe spaces both online and physically and we encourage everyone to bring their whole selves to RMIT.\nLearn more about RMIT's commitment to diversity and inclusion\n.\nThe language of disability\nRMIT acknowledges that language concerning identity continues to evolve. In accordance with guidance provided by the Australian Network on Disability, RMIT uses ‘person first’ language to describe people with disability, while acknowledging many people with disability prefer to use identity-first language. Identity-first language puts a person’s disability identity before the person – for example, ‘disabled person’ or ‘Autistic’ – instead of ‘person with autism’; ‘Deaf’ – instead of ‘person who is deaf’. Many prefer to use identity-first language as they regard their disability as a key part of their identity. They use identity-first language to show their connection to the disability community, demonstrate disability pride and emphasise that it is society that is disabling. Of course, when interacting directly with people or describing them, we respect and use their preferred way of describing themselves.\nThis service receives funding from SSAF\nLearn more about SSAF\nAcknowledgement of Country\nRMIT University acknowledges the people of the Woi wurrung and Boon wurrung language groups of the eastern Kulin Nation on whose unceded lands we conduct the business of the University. RMIT University respectfully acknowledges their Ancestors and Elders, past and present. RMIT also acknowledges the Traditional Custodians and their Ancestors of the lands and waters across Australia where we conduct our business - Artwork 'Sentient' by Hollie Johnson, Gunaikurnai and Monero Ngarigo.\nMore information\nLibrary\nMaps\nCampus facilities\nStudent Connect\nContacts\nNew students\nEnrol as a new student\nBefore semester starts\nOrientation\nFirst weeks\nSupport\nEnrol as a new student\nBefore semester starts\nOrientation\nFirst weeks\nSupport\nMy course\nEnrolment\nCanvas\nClass timetables\nImportant dates\nFees, loans and payments\nEnrolment\nCanvas\nClass timetables\nImportant dates\nFees, loans and payments\nServices and support\nMy details and ID card\nIT support and systems\nHealth, safety and wellbeing\nInternational students\nMy details and ID card\nIT support and systems\nHealth, safety and wellbeing\nInternational students\nStudent life\nClubs and societies\nEvents and activities\nSport and fitness\nAccommodation\nClubs and societies\nEvents and activities\nSport and fitness\nAccommodation\nCareers and opportunities\nJobs, careers and employability\nInternships, work experience & WIL\nScholarships\nStudy overseas\nJobs, careers and employability\nInternships, work experience & WIL\nScholarships\nStudy overseas\nCopyright © 2025 RMIT University\n|\nTerms\n|\nPrivacy\n|\nAccessibility\n|\nWebsite feedback\n|\nComplaints\n|\nABN 49 781 030 034\n|\nCRICOS provider number: 00122A\n|\nTEQSA provider number: PRV12145\n|\nRTO Code: 3046\n|\nOpen Universities Australia\n|\nRMIT Training Pty Ltd, trading as RMIT University Pathways (RMIT UP), CRICOS Provider Code: 01912G",

It gives you those management tools that maybe you don't get at Uni and it also just kind of\ngives you a great kind of group of people that you can support on.\nMARLON SPEAKS: Leadership through clubs is such a special place to cultivate skills.

work experience\nInternships and work experience\nWhat is an internship or work experience?\nInternships and work experience are formal experiences where you can develop your professional skills in the industry aligned to your studies.\nThese experiences look great on your resume and show that you’ve gained real industry experience before you’ve graduated from your qualification.\nYou can complete these experiences outside of your course and they will not be assessed for credit towards your qualification.\nFor more information about work experience and internships, including whether these opportunities should be paid or unpaid, visit\nFair Work Australia\n.\nWhere can I find internship and work experience opportunities?\nCareer Centre\n– Search job and internship opportunities from all over the world\nGlobal opportunities\n– Overseas internship opportunities\nProsple\nGrad Connection\nWork Integrated Learning (WIL)\nWork Integrated Learning (WIL)\nWhat is WIL?\nWIL is a learning activity where you use your academic learning in a real-life situation, with a real industry or community partner.\nHigher Education and Vocational Education students can complete a WIL activity, which is formally assessed for credit towards your qualification.\nThe type of WIL activities you undertake depends on your program and study discipline and can occur on or off campus. They may be in the form of:\nWork placements such as clinical placements, internships, cooperative and field education, vocational and professional practices\nProjects with industry and community-based organisations\nArt projects with exhibitions\nWIL simulations such as activities where you practice using industry technology, equipment or activities that are too risky or not possible to complete in an industry setting e.g. moot courts\nOffshore and online activities\nBenefits of WIL\nA WIL activity gives you the opportunity to:\nLearn new professional skills and put theory into practice\nAdd professional experience and skills to your resume\nDevelop transferable skills, such as problem solving, teamwork and communication\nUnderstand work culture and specific competencies of professions and industries\nEstablish a network of contacts – potentially resulting in you gaining a job role\nThrough a WIL activity, you can evaluate whether you enjoy working in the industry and if it’s a career path you want to pursue. Maybe you’ll love it or maybe you won’t, but that’s ok – WIL is an opportunity for you to ‘test drive’ the industry.\nFinding a WIL activity\nDepending on your course, you may be required to secure your own WIL activity, or you may be allocated one.\nIf you’re unsure about this, check your\ncourse guide\nor\ncontact your WIL coordinator\n.\nCheck out the links below for more information.\nYour WIL activity\nOnce you secure your WIL activity, you must complete several preparation tasks and be aware of the important requirements of WIL.\nWIL contacts and supports\nFind how to contact your WIL coordinator, who to contact in an emergency, or how to access InPlace support.\nBusiness and Law Internship electives\nUse your spare elective to gain invaluable real work experience as part of your academic studies through undertaking a WIL internship.\nAcknowledgement of Country\nRMIT University acknowledges the people of the Woi wurrung and Boon wurrung language groups of the eastern Kulin Nation on whose unceded lands we conduct the business of the University. RMIT University respectfully acknowledges their Ancestors and Elders, past and present.

It also displays your study load (also known as aggregated load) in the program for a specific period.\nThe SoE shows your study load calculated for ‘First half calendar year’ (1 January to 30 June) and ‘Second half calendar year' (1 July to 31 December). This includes the portion of any class that falls within that period.\nYour SoE proves your enrolment and/or study load for concession or other purposes e.g., Victorian Public Transport Concession and Centrelink income support payments.\nThe SoE will also help you determine if you will complete your program within the minimum time.\nFor global partner students, your study load is expressed as part-time or full-time based on the number of credit points you enrol in each study term. Typically, a full-time load is 36 credit points or more per study term, while a part-time load is less than 36 credit points.\nMake sure you check the enrolment details in your SoE carefully to ensure they're correct.\nIf you’re enrolled in multiple programs, you’ll receive multiple SoEs.\nHow to view your Statement of Enrolment\nCurrent\nstudents\nFor most current students, your SoE is available in Enrolment Online the day after you enrol or vary your enrolment.

Selecting a major or minor will help you gain a deeper understanding of your chosen discipline, enhancing your expertise and giving you an edge in your chosen career.\nTo learn more about how majors and minors work for your program, check your\nprogram guide\nand\nenrolment program structure\n.\nWhat are majors?\nA major is structured to progress you from foundational knowledge to advanced skills in a specific discipline or area of specialisation.\nIn some programs, completing a major is required to graduate. In others, completing a major is optional.\nMost Majors consist of a set of courses totalling\n96 credit points\n, which equals one year of full-time study.\nTo learn how majors work in your program and when you need to choose a major, check your\nprogram guide\nand\nenrolment program structure\n.\nWhat are minors?\nMinors add variety to your degree and allow you to explore a discipline without committing to a full major, providing you with a solid foundation of knowledge and intermediate skills in a specific subject.\nMinors often include courses that are also part of individual majors or other minors, but each course can only be credited towards one major or minor. Many RMIT programs offer a range of minors within their structure.\nA minor consists of a pre-selected set of courses totalling\n48 credit points\n, which is equivalent to half a year or one semester of full-time study.\nMajors and graduation documents\nUpon completing your program, your confirmed major/s will be recorded on your:\nTestamur\nTranscript\nStatement of Academic Completion (SAC)\nAustralian Higher Education Graduation Statement (AHEGS).\nFor more information about your graduation documents, visit\nAcademic transcripts and statements\n.\nMajor and minor combinations\nDepending on your program , course selections you have made and any credit you have received, you will have the option to graduate with a combination of majors and minors within your degree. These requirements are specific to the program, so refer to your\nprogram guide\nand\nenrolment program structure\nfor more information.\nMajors and accreditation\nSome programs are planned to meet the requirements set by external accreditation bodies, which may limit the choice of courses within a program.\nThese accreditation requirements ensure that the curriculum meets the standards necessary for professional certification and practice. In some cases, the major of a program is based around the requirement of this external accreditation. Check your\nprogram guide\nand\nenrolment program structure\nfor more information about how your major or minor works with accreditation, and\ncontact Student Connect\nif you have any questions.\nHow to nominate your major and minor\nLog in to Enrolment Online.\nClick on\nMy student record\n.\nClick on\nChoose/View Majors and Minors\n.\nChoose the majors and minors you intend to study in your program and submit your selections.\nIf you wish to change your selections or receive further guidance about your intended study plan, please\ncontact Student Connect\n.\nLog in to Enrolment Online\nChanging your major\nYou may be able to change your declared major. Changing your major may have implications for credit, program duration, accreditation or post study work rights for visa holders.\nPlease\nseek course and program advice in Student Connect\nto learn more about your eligibility and the implications of changing your nominated major or minor.\nNeed help?\nFor more information about nominating a major or minor, refer to your\nprogram guide\nand\nenrolment program structure\n.\nFor help with planning your studies, for instance how\ncredit for prior study or credit for prior experience\nmight affect your options when nominating your majors and minors,\nvisit the ask about your course or program page\nin Student Connect or\nreach out for academic advice\n.\nOnce you’ve made your selection, if you wish to make changes to your major or minor at a later date you’ll need to\ncontact Student Connect\nto check if you’re eligible.\nAcknowledgement of Country\nRMIT University acknowledges the people of the Woi wurrung and Boon wurrung language groups of the eastern Kulin Nation on whose unceded lands we conduct the business of the University.

We're going to take you through the basics now.\nBefore you can timetable, you need to enrol in all your courses for the upcoming semester. After you've done this, go to the RMIT Students webpage to find out when and how timetabling works. It's really important to note the dates and times to complete each step.\nFor higher education courses, timetabling works on the preferential model. This means RMIT considers your class preferences when allocating you to classes. You can timetable in three easy steps.\nFirst, log into myTimetable to plan what classes you want. Next, enter your class preferences. Make sure you do this before the deadline or RMIT will automatically allocate you to classes. myTimetable closes while RMIT sorts all preferences.\nAfter preferences are sorted, you can see the classes you've been allocated. If you want, you can then adjust your classes on a 'first in, first served' basis. For example, if you didn't get all your preferences or your circumstances changed since you entered your preferences.\nAnd that's it, you've got your personal class timetable at RMIT. If you need any help, contact RMIT Connect.\n[End transcript]\nBack to video\nFor higher education classes, timetabling works off the preferential model. This means you get to indicate your preferred classes, then the system allocates you to classes, then finally, you can adjust your timetable.\nThe process is easy: just log in to myTimetable (see above) then follow the steps below.\nStep 1. Plan your timetable\nSemester/term\nWhen to complete this step\nSemester 1 2025\nFrom 10am Monday 2 December 2024\nSemester 2 2025\nFrom 10am Monday 26 May 2025\nBefore classes start, you can view the upcoming semester's timetable in read only mode. You can’t allocate yourself to classes during this period, but you can see all class times and locations, and plan which classes you’d like to be in.\nHow to see class times and locations\nFind your courses listed in the\nEnrolment\npanel on the left side of the screen of myTimetable\nClick on each class (TUT tutorial, PRA practical, WRK workshop, etc.) to see times and locations.\nHelpful info – How to read class locations and other room numbers at RMIT\nAll rooms at RMIT are numbered in the following way: Building number. Floor number. Room number. That means, if the location is 080.04.020, it's building 80, level 4, room 20. For more information, go to\nClass timetable FAQs\n.\nDo you see\nMore information\nfor some courses? That means classes for that course aren’t scheduled in myTimetable. Check your\ncourse guide\nfor more information or contact\nStudent Connect\n.\nAre courses in your Enrolment panel missing or incorrect? Go to\nClass timetable FAQs\nto find out what to do.\nStep 2: Enter your preferences\nSemester/term\nWhen to complete this step\nSemester 1 2025\n10am Friday 24 January - 5pm Sunday 9 February 2025\nSemester 2 2025\n10am Tuesday 10 June - 5pm Sunday 22 June 2025\nYou can enter your preferences anytime during the preference entry period. You will not have a better chance of being allocated to a class because you enter your preferences at the beginning of the period, rather than at the end. You can change your preferences as many times as you like during the preference entry period.\nHow to enter your preferences\nIn the Enrolment panel, click on a class that has a status of\nPREFERENCE\nUse the dropdown boxes to number each class; with 1 being your most preferred class, 2 being your second most preferred class, etc\nClick\nSave\n. When you’ve successfully entered your preferences for a class, the icon next to the class in the Enrolment panel will change from red (not allocated) to orange (pending)\nRepeat for each class with a status of\nPREFERENCE\nYou’ll see a percentage next to each class. This indicates how popular that class is; the higher the percentage, the less chance you have of getting a place in that class.\nIf there is only one option for a class, the system will allocate you to the class automatically. You don’t need to enter a preference.\nIf you don’t enter preferences during this period, you will be automatically allocated to classes after students who have entered preferences.\nHelpful info – When the preference entry period closes, classes temporarily disappear from myTimetable\nAfter the preference entry period has closed, your classes will not appear in myTimetable while RMIT allocates students to classes. You can view your classes again when Review and allocation adjustment opens (see below).\nStep 3: Review and adjust your timetable\nSemester/term\nWhen to complete this step\nSemester 1 2025\n10am Monday 17 February - 5pm Tuesday 1 April 2025\nSemester 2 2025\n10am Monday 30 June - 5pm Friday 15 August 2025\nOnce you have been allocated to classes and your timetable becomes available, you can review and adjust your timetable during the allocation adjustment period. Allocation adjustment happens on a first-in, first-served basis, so it’s a good idea to log in early.\nHow to review and adjust your timetable\nIn the\nEnrolment\npanel, find any class with a status of\nSELECT\n(this means you haven’t been allocated to a class and must select one) or\nADJUST\n(this means you can change from your allocated class to another class, assuming there are available places).\nClick on the class with a status of\nSELECT\nor\nADJUST\nand the class options will display\nTo select or adjust a class, click the blue\nSelect\nbutton next to your desired class. You can’t select a class with a red\nClash\nbutton or red\nFull\nbutton\nRepeat this process for each class. When there is a green tick next to each activity in the current semester, you are finished\nIs the class you want full? Go to\nClass timetable FAQs\nto find out how to request a place in a full class.\nView your personal class timetable\nAll done! You can now view your personal timetable in myTimetable by clicking\nTimetable\nin the menu bar. You can also print and share your timetable using the icons, or feed your timetable into your calendar. Go to\nClass timetable FAQs\nfor more information.\nNeed help?\nCheck\nClass timetable FAQs\nfor more information. If you still can’t find what you’re looking for, contact\nStudent Connect\n.\nIf you’re having technical issues accessing myTimetable, contact\nIT Service Connect\n.\nAcknowledgement of Country\nRMIT University acknowledges the people of the Woi wurrung and Boon wurrung language groups of the eastern Kulin Nation on whose unceded lands we conduct the business of the University.

See the\nI can't see lectures in myTimetable FAQ\nfor more information.\nHow do I find the location of my classroom or other rooms at RMIT?\nThe location column in myTimetable (see screenshot below) will list your classroom's room number (eg. 080.04.020).\nHow to read room numbers at RMIT\nAll rooms at RMIT are numbered in the following way: Building number. Floor number. Room number. That means, if the location is 080.04.020, it's building 80, level 4, room 20.\nYou'll find building locations on the\nMaps page\nand floor and room signage inside each building.\nOnline classes\nIn a few cases some classes maybe delivered online. You can tell if a class is delivered online because the campus column in myTimetable will display ‘Canvas’ or the location column will display ‘Refer_to_canvas’ (see screenshot below).\nIt says 'Canvas' in the campus or location column for my class, what does that mean?\nIf the campus column for your class displays 'Canvas', or the location column displays 'Refer_to_canvas', it means this class will be delivered online via Canvas.\nSome of my classes have –P1 and –P2 in the activity column, what does that mean?\nThis means your class has two or more 'parts' and might be delivered in a different location from week to week.\nSee the screenshot below.\nFirst, look at the activity column. Each class is numbered 01, 02, 03, etc. Each part is displayed as P1, P2, etc. So, in the example below, the 01 class has two parts, 01-P1 and 01-P2.\nLook at the campus, location and weeks columns to determine your class location from week to week. In the example below, 01-P1 classes are delivered at Melbourne City campus, whereas 01-P2 classes are delivered online via Canvas.\nWhen selecting your class preferences, note that you can only select one complete class, and you are expected to attend all parts of the one class. You cannot mix-and-match parts from across different classes.\nHow does timetabling work?\nExpand all sections\nHow do I get my class timetable?\nHigher education students (Bachelor, Master, Graduate Certificate, Graduate Diploma and Higher Degree by Research) should follow the instructions on the\nHigher education guide to timetabling\n.\nVocational education students (Certificate I-IV, Diploma, Advanced Diploma or Associate Degree) should follow the instructions on the\nVocational education guide to timetabling\n.\nIf you’re an Associate Degree student who needs to enrol in one or more higher education courses, you’ll need to follow the higher education instructions for your higher education courses and the vocational education instructions for your vocational education courses.\nWhat's preferential entry?\nPreferential entry is used for higher education and some associate degree timetabling.\nIt means you get to indicate your preferred classes, then the system will allocate you to classes based on your preferences and class availability. Selecting preferences does not guarantee you will be allocated to those classes but it does give you a much better chance of having the timetable that is suitable for you.\nSee the\nHigher education guide to timetabling\nfor more information.\nCan I change my class preferences?\nYes, during the preference entry period you can change your class preferences as many times as you like.\nAfter the preference entry period has closed, myTimetable will be unavailable while RMIT allocates students to classes and you won’t be able to make changes until the allocation adjustment period opens. During the allocation adjustment period, all students can make changes to their timetables on a ‘first-in, first-served’ basis.\nDates for the preference entry period and allocation adjustment period are listed in the\nKey timetable dates\nsection of the\nClass timetables page\n.\nWhat if I enrol in a course after the preference entry period has closed?\nFor higher education students, if you enrol in a course\nup to 4 business days\nafter the preference entry period has closed, RMIT will automatically allocate you to classes. If you are not happy with your automatically allocated classes, you can swap or change your classes in myTimetable when the allocation adjustment period opens.\nIf you enrol in a course\nmore than 4 business days\nafter the preference entry period has closed, you will not be allocated to classes and must select classes in myTimetable once the allocation adjustment period opens.\nTo find out when the preference entry and allocation adjustment periods occur, please go to\nClass timetables page\nand refer to the key timetabling dates table. Remember, allocation adjustment happens on a first-in, first-serve basis.\nCan I see class times for courses I'm not currently enrolled in?\nYes, you can use the search bar in myTimetable, under the enrolment panel (located in the bottom left-hand corner of the screen) to find and view class times for all courses, including courses you aren't enrolled in. If you aren't a current RMIT student, you can view all classes via the public read-only version of myTimetable available on the\nClass timetables page\n.\nCan I feed my class timetable into my personal calendar?\nYes, after you’ve created your personal class timetable, you can add it to your Apple calendar, Google calendar, Outlook calendar, etc.\nLog in to myTimetable via the\nClass timetables page\nScroll to the bottom of the myTimetable homepage to the\nSubscribe to your timetable\nsection\nCopy the URL\nUse the appropriate instructions below to add your timetable to your calendar:\nOutlook calendar – subscribe to a calendar\nApple calendar – subscribe to a calendar\nGoogle calendar – add using a link\nSelecting classes\nExpand all sections\nI have classes that clash. What can I do?\nHigher education students\nClass times are selected to ensure core course options are clash-free, but it’s not possible to cater for every elective option or non-standard enrolment, for example when taking courses from different year levels from your program. If you have an unavoidable tutorial, workshop, or lab clash, you should discuss your enrolment options with your School or your Program Coordinator.\nVocational education students\nIf you’re enrolled in the correct group code or class section, your timetable should be clash-free. Contact your school through\nStudent Connect\nto ensure you’re enrolled in the correct group code.\nI didn't get the class I want! What can I do?\nYou can adjust your personal class timetable when myTimetable opens for allocation adjustment. This is when any remaining spaces in classes become available on a ‘first-in, first-served’ basis.\nDates for the allocation adjustment period are listed on the\nClass timetables page\n.\nTo request a place in a full class, see below.\nCan I increase my chances of getting allocated to a particular class?\nWhen RMIT allocates students to classes, we try to make sure as many students get their first preferences as possible, however there are no guarantees.\nIf you only select very popular classes, your chances of getting your preferred classes will be lower. You can tell what classes are popular in myTimetable from the percentage beside the 'Preference' dropdown box for each class. A higher percentage indicates the class is very popular.\nFor example, you are more likely to get into a class at 53% popularity compared to a class at 100% popularity or higher. To increase your chance of getting allocated to a class, preference classes with a lower popularity percentage.\nHow do I request a place in a full class?\nDuring the allocation adjustment period, you can use the myTimetable swap ‘heart’ function to request a place in a full class – if a place becomes available, you’ll automatically be allocated to the class.\nYou can request multiple swaps. For example, if ten tutorials are available and five of those work with your existing timetable, you can request a place in all five tutorials. If a swap is successful and you are placed into one of your requested tutorials, all other swap requests for that tutorial will be cancelled.\nThere's no guarantee that you'll be placed into a requested class. Please don’t attend classes that are full, as numbers in each class are limited to meet health and safety requirements and quality of teaching standards. Further, attending classes that you’re not allocated into may cause problems with assessment and/or results.\nHow to make a swap request\nLog in to myTimetable via the\nClass timetables page\nIn the myTimetable\nEnrolment\npanel,\nclick on the class you want to swap\nand you’ll be presented with alternative time options offered for the class\nNext to each class that’s full you’ll see a heart.\nClick on the heart\nto request a place in the class. You can request a place in as many classes as you like\nIf a place becomes available, the system will automatically allocate you to your requested class and remove you from your original class\nIf you submit a swap request but change your mind, don't forget to remove the request by clicking on the heart again.\nIf I have back-to-back classes in different buildings of the campus, will I have time to get from one class to the next class?\nyes, classes will finish 10 minutes prior to the timetabled end time. This is to ensure students and teaching staff have sufficient time to pack and relocate to their next class.\nMissing classes and technical issues\nExpand all sections\nI can't see my lectures in myTimetable. Does that mean I don't have lectures?\nYes, higher education courses (subjects) at RMIT do not include lectures. So, if you can’t see lectures in your timetable, it means you don’t have lectures for that course.\nInstead, you will be learning through digital content accessed via Canvas on demand, at your own pace, outside of your timetabled classes. These will prepare you for your face-to-face classes where you will be able to discuss, reflect and apply what you have learnt. It also means that you'll have more time in face-to-face classes to learn through interaction with teachers and other students.\nSome vocational education courses do still have lectures. If you are enrolled in a course with lectures they WILL appear in your timetable.\nMy courses (subjects) are missing or aren't correct in myTimetable? What should I do?\nIf you can't see any courses (subjects) in the enrolment panel in myTimetable, or you’re seeing courses you don’t think you should be enrolled in, see the relevant section below.\nHigher education students\nCheck that you’re correctly enrolled via your Confirmation of Enrolment statement available in\nEnrolment Online\n. If you aren’t enrolled correctly and need to add to or change your enrolment via Enrolment Online, you need to wait 60 minutes before that course will display in myTimetable.\nIf you've done this, and your enrolment in Enrolment Online and myTimetable still don’t match, contact\nStudent Connect\n.\nVocational education students\nIf two or more of your courses are taught together in a 'cluster', you'll see a reduced number of courses and classes in your myTimetable enrolment window. This is normal for clustered courses, and you don’t need to take any action.\nIf some/all of your courses are missing, or you’re seeing too many courses in myTimetable, your School may have enrolled you in the incorrect group code.\nContact the College of Vocational Education\nfor assistance.\nSome or all my classes are missing in myTimetable. What should I do?\nIf you cannot see your facilitated classes (tutorials, lectorials, workshops, practicals, etc.) or vocational education lectures in myTimetable, your course may not have been entered into myTimetable yet. Please check again the week prior to the start of semester. If you're not sure when semester starts, check the relevant\nImportant dates\n.\nI'm seeing an error or can't log in to myTimetable. What should I do?\nThere are some common technical issues you may experience when using myTimetable.\nStudents enrolled in a program through\nRMIT Online\ndo not use myTimetable. Contact your program coordinator for information on your class times.\nIf you’re experiencing long login or loading time, it’s most likely because the system is under high demand. Please wait at least 30 seconds before refreshing a page, or you'll be moved to the back of the server queue for the system.\nFor password issues, visit\nRMIT ID and password\n.\nIf the information above didn't answer your technical issue, please contact\nIT Service Connect\nfor personalised support.\nNeed help?\nIf you are having technical issues accessing myTimetable, contact\nIT Service Connect\nOtherwise contact\nStudent Connect\nAcknowledgement of Country\nRMIT University acknowledges the people of the Woi wurrung and Boon wurrung language groups of the eastern Kulin Nation on whose unceded lands we conduct the business of the University.

The fees you’ll pay depend on your citizenship, the type of place you’ve been offered and the year you commenced your studies.\nFee type\nWhat the fees cover\nTuition fees\nThese are charged to all higher education, vocational education and preparatory students. You’ll be charged a fee to cover the cost of each course (subject) of your program.\nMaterial and administration fees\nThese include fees and charges for activities such as field trips or materials like printing dyes or fabrics that become your property.\nStudent Services and Amenities Fee (SSAF)\nThe SSAF is a compulsory fee set by the Australian Government on an annual basis. It funds services of a non-academic nature such as support services, clubs and careers events.\nHow to view your fees and due dates\nAll information about your fees is in Enrolment Online:\nLog in to\nEnrolment Online\nwith your RMIT email address and password.\nForgotten your password? Reset it\n.\nSelect\nMy student record.\nUnder the\nFinancial details\nmenu, click\nView account/pay fees.\nYou can also view and print your\ntax invoice\nin\nMy student record\n.\nOverdue fees\nIf you don't pay your fees by their due date there may be serious consequences, including the cancellation of your enrolment. Go to\nOverdue fees and penalties\nfor details.\nLog in to Enrolment Online\nAbout your tax invoice\nHELP loans and CSPs\nHELP loans and CSPs\nHELP loans\nYou may be eligible to apply for a HELP loan or VET Student Loan to cover some or all of your tuition fees.\nIf you are a domestic higher education student, you may also be eligible to apply for an SA-HELP loan to cover the Student Services and Amenities Fee (SSAF)\nFind out more on the\nHELP loan and VET Student Loan webpages\n.\nHigher education students in a Commonwealth Supported Place (CSP)\nYour fees are paid in part by the Australian Government. The remaining amount shown on your invoice is your student contribution.\nIt's a government condition of your enrolment into a\nCommonwealth Supported Place (CSP)\nthat you pay your student contribution, or successfully apply for a HECS-HELP loan (if eligible) by the census date.\nStudent Learning Entitlement (SLE)\nOn 1 January 2022, the Australian government introduced the Student Learning Entitlement (SLE).\nThe\nStudent Learning Entitlement (SLE)\nis the amount of study you can undertake in a\nCommonwealth Supported Place (CSP)\nin your lifetime.\nThe SLE allows you to undertake 7 years (7 EFTSL) of full-time subsidised study in a\nCommonwealth Suported Place (CSP)\n. Any course taken by you in a CSP that has a census date after 1 January 2022 will reduce your SLE balance by the EFTSL value of that course.\nOnce you have used all available SLE, you will be transferred to a full-fee paying place for the remainder of your study.\nYou can receive additional SLE in EFTSL, when undertaking certain courses or when certain events occur.\nYou may have your SLE amount re-credited where\nspecial circumstances apply or where their HELP balance is re-credited.\nHow do I find out my SLE balance?\nYou can check your SLE by logging in to\nMyHELP balance.\nOnce you reach your SLE limit, you are no longer entitled to undertake study in a CSP.\nSLE calculation example\nAlex commenced a Bachelor of Science with a CSP, on 1 January 2021. The courses undertaken in 2021 did not reduce their SLE amount.\nIn 2022, Alex enrols in a total of eight courses of study, four courses in each semester. As Alex is still enrolled in four courses after the Semester One 2022 census date passes, their SLE amount is reduced by 0.5 EFTSL. As Alex is still enrolled in the four courses after the Semester Two 2022 census date passes, their SLE amount is reduced by a further 0.5 EFTSL.\nAlex’s SLE amount at the end of the year will be:\n7 EFTSL - 1 EFTSL (0.5 EFTSL x 2 Semesters) = 6 EFTSL.\nThis means Alex has 6 years left of Commonwealth supported study.\nMore information about SLE\nCommonwealth Support Places and HECS-HELP\nbooklet for students\nStudent Learning Entitlement website\nfor students.\nHow to pay your fees\nHow to pay your fees\nThe preferred method is online via Visa or Mastercard, but you can also pay using other methods including from an overseas bank account.\nHow to pay your fees\nOverdue fees and penalties\nOverdue fees and penalties\nIf you don't pay your fees by their due date there may be serious consequences, including the cancellation of your enrolment.\nHigher education students in a Commonwealth Supported Place\nYour fees are paid in part by the Australian Government. The remaining amount shown on your invoice is your student contribution.\nIt's a government condition of your enrolment into a Commonwealth Supported Place (CSP) that you pay your student contribution or successfully apply for a\nHECS-HELP loan\n(if eligible) by the\ncensus date\n.\nIf you don't pay or secure your loan by the census date, RMIT is required under the Higher Education Support Act to cancel your enrolment until the next study period.\nThere is no extension to the due date for your fees in a CSP.\nIf your enrolment is cancelled for failing to pay your student contribution by the census date, you:\nwill not be financially liable for the classes that are cancelled\nwill have Student Learning Entitlement (SLE) deductions re-credited\ncan re-enrol in your classes in the next study period (if available).\nAll other students\nYou must pay all fees by the due date on your invoice. If you don't pay your fees by the due date, you may:\nhave restrictions placed on your student record\nhave your enrolment cancelled\nbecome a University debtor\nbe referred to an external debt collection agency\nbecome non-compliant with your student visa requirements\nlose your scholarship or international sponsorship.\nThe following information explains what these penalties mean.\nDebtor restrictions\nWhen fees are not paid by the due date, we apply certain restrictions to your student record. These restrictions will mean that you can't enrol, add classes, obtain a transcript of results or a Statement of Academic Completion, receive an award, or view your academic history (results) in\nEnrolment Online\n.\nCancellation of enrolment and debt collection\nIf you have more than $500 of unpaid tuition fees in your account after the due date, RMIT may cancel your enrolment in all of your current programs.\nIf your enrolment is cancelled you will:\nbe cancelled in all current programs even if you have paid (or have an approved\nHELP loan or VET Student Loan\n) for any other program/s that you're enrolled in\nneed to reapply to the University if you wish to continue your studies in the cancelled program/s\nbe required to pay the tuition fees for any course you've already received a grade for or that has already finished, as well as any materials or other fees e.g. Library fines.\nAny payments that you owe will be referred to a debt collection agency.

If your eCoE is cancelled, you may be in breach of your visa conditions.\nYou should contact the\nDepartment of Home Affairs (DHA)\nimmediately to find out what action you need to take to ensure you remain legally in Australia. If you don't contact the DHA, your student visa may be cancelled.\nScholarship and international sponsored students\nIt's your responsibility to ensure that the funds to cover your fees are paid into your student account before the due date for each charge. If they're not, your fees will become overdue and the penalties outlined above will apply.\nApprentices and trainees\nIf you become a university debtor, your enrolment will not be cancelled, but restrictions will be applied to your student record, and you will be referred to an external debt collection agency.\nIt is recommended that apprentices and trainees establish an employer sponsorship arrangement, so your employer is invoiced directly.\nIf you have received an fee invoice, and you believe you have a sponsorship arrangement in place, please email\nstudent.sponsorship@rmit.edu.au\n.\nHELP loans and VET Student Loans\nHELP loans and VET Student Loans cover tuition fees only. Administration and material fees are not covered by loans and need to be paid by the due date.\nIt's your responsibility to keep track of your combined HELP loan limit. Once you reach your HELP loan limit, you need to pay your remaining tuition fees by the due date.\nVE fee concession\nVocational education student fee concessions\nIf eligible, you can apply for a concession (discount) on fees for your government subsidised place in an RMIT vocational education program.\nYou must apply before your class start date to access the concession fee rate.\nYou're eligible for a fee concession if:\nyou're enrolling in a certificate I-IV program, and\nhold a valid\nCommonwealth Health Care Card\n, or be named on the card as a dependant child/spouse, or hold a valid Pensioner Concession Card, or be named on the card as a dependant child/spouse, or hold a valid Veterans' Gold Card.\nYou're ineligible to apply for a fee concession if you:\nare enrolled in a diploma level program or above (including diploma, advanced diploma, vocational graduate certificate or vocational graduate diploma) unless you are an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander student in a government subsidised place\nare enrolled in an Australian full-fee place or international full-fee place.\nRead more about fee concessions\nNeed help?\nIf you have a question about your fees, contact\nStudent Connect\n.\nIf you're having trouble paying your fees or experiencing financial difficulties, there is help available.\nBook an appointment with a Student Support Advisor\nas soon as possible to discuss your options.

You don’t have to pay the fees covered by your loan; however, there are other fees and charges that may need to be paid, such as the\nStudent Services and Amenities Fee (SSAF)\nand material fees.\nWhy have I received a VET Student Loan Statement of Covered Fees and VET Student Loan Fee Notice?\nAll vocational education students eligible for a VET Student Loan will receive this notice with their tax invoice, even if they haven’t applied for a loan.\nIf you have an approved VET Student Loan, this notice will indicate which fees are covered by your loan, and any fees that aren’t covered. If you don’t have an approved VET Student Loan, you will need to pay all fees by their due date.\nWhy are some of my tuition fees not covered by my VET Student Loan?\nYour VET Student Loan covers your tuition fees in two separate fee periods:\nFee period 1 –\n1 January to 30 June\nFee period 2\n– 1 July to 31 December\nThis means that tuition fees for courses with a census date in the current fee period will be covered by your VET Student Loan.\nTuition fees for courses with a census date in the next fee period will show as due charges on your invoice until that fee period commences.\nA new invoice, with an updated VET Student Loan Statement of Covered Fees and VET Student Loan Fee Notice, will be issued to you shortly before the commencement of each fee period, or when you add or drop a course, detailing the tuition fees that are now covered by your VET Student Loan.\nWhy are some tuition fees in the current fee period still not covered by my VET Student Loan?\nYou may have reached your program loan limit. Each VET Student Loan approved program has a loan limit. If your VET Student Loan limit doesn't cover the total amount of tuition fees for your program, you need to pay the difference by the due date.\nYour program loan limit is stated on your VET Student Loan Statement of Covered Fees and VET Student Loan Fee Notice.\nSee a list of approved VET Student Loan programs and their loan limits\n.\nI have paid my fees, however I haven't received a new invoice – why not?\nCheck your current balance in\nEnrolment Online\n.

loan\nExplainer & eligibility\nWhat is a student loan?\nA HELP loan or VET Student Loan (VSL) is a government loan that allows you to defer part or all of the cost of your studies. If you have an approved HELP loan or VSL, your fees will automatically defer to your loan shortly after each census date. You\npay back your loan\n(debt) through the tax system once you earn above the compulsory repayment threshold or you can make\nvoluntary repayments\nto the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) at any time.\nEligibility\nYour eligibility for a HELP loan or VET Student Loan depends on criteria such as your citizenship status, your residency during study,  and whether you're in an undergraduate, postgraduate or vocational education program.\nFind out what you may be eligible for on the Australian Government's\nStudy Assist website\n.\nIf you’re an Australian Permanent Resident, Permanent Humanitarian Visa holder (or eligible former Permanent Humanitarian Visa holder) or New Zealand citizen (or eligible former New Zealand Special Category Visa holder), find out about your eligibility on the\nNon-Australian citizens\npage.\nNew Zealand students on a Special Category Visa (or former SCV holders)\nIf you're a New Zealand citizen on a Special Category Visa (SCV), or a Permanent Resident (who was formally an eligible NZ SCV holder) studying in Australia, you may be eligible for a HELP loan or VET Student Loan if you meet the long-term residency requirements. For details on these requirements, please visit the\nNon-Australian citizens page\n.\nTo assess your eligibility, RMIT requires a copy of your\nInternational Movement Record\n. You can request a copy of this document by visiting the\nDepartment of Home Affairs website\n. We recommend applying for this document immediately after enrolment to allow the department time to process the request, and RMIT to assess your eligibility before your first census date.\nRMIT may also accept other documents which prove you meet the long-term residency requirements. This includes, but isn't limited to, the following:\nAustralian academic transcripts (including VET transcripts).\nSchool reports or certificates.\nAustralian student ID card.\nStudents who choose to supply documents from the above list must supply one document per calendar year, with 8 documents supplied in total from the previous 10-year period.\nPlease submit your documents via\nStudent Connect\nat least 5 business days before your first census date for assessment of your eligibility and resubmission of your updated eCAF if deemed eligible.\nApply for a loan\nApply for a loan\nSelect which type of loan you'd like to apply for below.\nHECS-HELP\nFind out if you're eligible for a HECS-HELP loan and how to apply.\nFEE-HELP\nFind out if you're eligible for a FEE-HELP loan and how to apply.\nVET Student Loans\nFind out if you're eligible for a VET Student Loan and how to apply.\nSA-HELP\nFind out if you're eligible for an SA-HELP loan to cover your Student Services and Amenities Fee (SSAF).\nView your loan status\nView your HELP loan or VET Student Loan status\nIf you have a HELP loan or VET Student Loan, you'll find the below information in\nEnrolment Online\nunder the\nFinancial details\nmenu.\nFeature\nDetails\nView Commonwealth Assistance (eCAF)\nView the status of your loans for your program or request an invitation to apply for a loan.\nView Commonwealth Assistance approval letters\nView the letter from RMIT confirming the approval of your loan.\nView Commonwealth Assistance Notices (CANs)\nView the CANs for your program.

Reset it\n.\nSelect\nMy student record.\nUnder\nFinancial details\n, select\nView Commonwealth Assistance Notices (CANs).\nLoan limit\nThere's a combined limit to how much you can borrow under HECS-HELP, FEE-HELP and VET Student Loans. This is called your\nHELP loan limit.\nIf you’ve reached your combined HELP loan limit, you’ll need to pay your student contribution (tuition fees) before the census date. If you're in a Commonwealth Supported Place (CSP), your enrolment will be cancelled after the census date if you don't pay your remaining fees for failing to meet the requirements of your CSP. All other students may have restrictions placed on their records and may have their enrolment cancelled.\nHow to check your combined HELP loan limit\nGo to the\nmyHELP balance portal\nto find out your current HELP limit and how much of your HELP balance you have left to borrow. For more information about the combined HELP limit, go to\nStudy Assist\n.\nFor more information about your specific loan, see the\nHECS-HELP\n,\nFEE-HELP\n,\nSA-HELP\nor\nVET Student Loans\nwebpage.\nMore information\nHow to pay your fees\nUnderstand your fees\nTax invoices\nTax File Number validation\nApply for a refund of HECS-HELP, FEE-HELP or a VET Student Loan\nContact\nStudent Connect\nAcknowledgement of Country\nRMIT University acknowledges the people of the Woi wurrung and Boon wurrung language groups of the eastern Kulin Nation on whose unceded lands we conduct the business of the University.

SSAF pays for non-academic services and amenities that don’t relate directly to your program – everything from clubs to career advisors. Check out what SSAF pays for at RMIT below.\nWhat does SSAF pay for?\nSSAF funds a wide range of online and face-to-face services and amenities:\nStudent employability\n, including\nCareer Connect\n,\nvolunteering\nand other\njob, career and employability opportunities\nStudent life\n, including\nclubs and societies\n,\nevents and activities\n,\nsport and fitness\nand programs to\nmake friends at RMIT\nStudents rights and representation\n, including\nRMIT University’s Student Union (RUSU) Student Rights Service\nand\nstudent representatives\nStudent welfare and wellbeing\n, including\ncounselling\nand\nfinancial and legal support\nRMIT departments and RUSU can also put forward project and activity proposals for SSAF funding. These are reviewed by the\nStudent Experience Advisory Group (SEAG) (PDF, 214KB)\nto ensure they meet all SSAF funding guidelines, and approved by the\nSSAF Steering Committee (PDF, 214KB)\n.\nRMIT ensures that all SSAF funding is spent in line with the\nAustralian Government SSAF Administration Guidelines.\nThe guidelines state that institutions can only spend SSAF on the provision of the services that fall under the\n19 allowable items\n. Providers can choose to deliver the services and amenities themselves or contract a third party to deliver the services and amenities on the providers' behalf.\nWant to find out more? Download the latest SSAF Allocation and Expenditure Report below, which includes details of actual SSAF allocation and expenditure.\n2023 SSAF Allocation & Expenditure Report (PDF)\nWho decides what SSAF is spent on?\nYour voice helps inform how your SSAF supports student life outside of the classroom at RMIT. As part of the student consultation process, RMIT students who pay SSAF are encouraged to complete the biennial \"Have Your Say: SSAF poll\". This poll allows students to provide feedback on which SSAF-funded services and activities are important to them and how they want the SSAF funds to be allocated. The poll results are then used to inform funding decisions.\nRMIT also engages with democratically elected student representatives and representatives from major student organisations regarding the specific uses of proceeds from SSAF. These include RUSU, strategic advisory groups and committees, and student focus groups.\nFor more information, download the\nSSAF Annual Student Consultation Process (PDF, 330KB)\n.\nHave Your Say Form\nWe want every student to share their thoughts and help make the student experience at RMIT the best it can be. Let us know your thoughts and ideas.\nComplete the form\nThanks SSAF\nLook out for the Thanks SSAF logo on webpages and at events. If you see the logo, it means the service or event was funded, in part or in full, by SSAF.\nWho pays SSAF?\nAny student who is studying an RMIT coursework program in Australia or online (including RMIT Online), and who is charged tuition fees by RMIT, will also be charged SSAF based on their enrolment.\nThis includes students studying in the Free TAFE initiative, and outbound exchange students who remain enrolled at RMIT.\nDomestic research students commencing in 2021 or later are also charged SSAF.\nIf you’re unsure about whether you are required to pay the fee, please view your student invoice or your online account in\nEnrolment Online\n.\nHow much does SSAF cost?\nHow much you pay in SSAF will depend on how many courses (subjects) you take each semester. SSAF rates are determined by the Australian Government and set on an annual basis.\nIn 2025, SSAF will be charged each semester at the following rates.\nHigher education and Foundation Studies students\nYou will be charged on a pro-rata basis each semester at the rate per credit point for each course you are enrolled in, up to the annual maximum for the year.\nYear\nMaximum annual SSAF\nSSAF rate per cedit point\n2025\n$365\n$3.81\nIf you are a local higher education student, you may be eligible for the SA-HELP loan scheme that allows you to defer paying the cost of the SSAF upfront.\nFind out more about SA-HELP\nVocational education students\nYou will be charged on a pro-rata basis each semester at the rate per nominal hour for each course you are enrolled in, up to the annual maximum for the year.\nIf you are a vocational education student and you are eligible for a concession on your tuition fees, you are also eligible for a concession on the SSAF.\nYear\nMaximum annual SSAF\nSSAF rate per nominal hour (no concession)\nSSAF rate per nominal hour (with concession)\n2025\n$365\n$0.51\n$0.10\nIf you change your enrolment before\ncensus date\n, this will affect the amount of SSAF you are charged for that semester. If you have already paid your SSAF for that semester, and your SSAF amount decreases because you\ndrop a course\nor\ntake a leave of absence\nbefore census date, you can\napply for a fee refund\n.\nIf you change your enrolment after census date, you will remain liable for your SSAF fee and\nSA-HELP\nfor that semester.\nWhen do I pay my SSAF?\nThe due date for SSAF is the same as for your course fees.\nIf you are enrolled in courses in a standard semester, your SSAF and course fees will generally be\ndue on the semester census date\n(see table below for 2025 census dates). You can also find your due date listed in\nEnrolment Online\nand on your\ninvoice\n.\nCohort\nSemester\nCensus date\nHigher education (Undergraduate and postgraduate) students\nSummer semester 2024-2025\n12 January 2025\nSemester 1 2025\n31 March 2025\nSemester 2 2025\n31 August 2025\nSpring semester 2025\n6 December 2025\nVocational education (TAFE) students\nSemester 1 2025\n31 March 2025\nSemester 2 2025\n1 September 2025\nIf you are enrolled in a flexible term, your SSAF will be calculated at the point you enrol and your SSAF due date will be listed in\nEnrolment Online\nand on your\ninvoice\n.\nHow do I pay my SSAF?\nSee your\ninvoice\nfor fee payment methods and due dates.\nYou are required to pay SSAF in full by the due date on your invoice, or apply to defer payment with\nSA-HELP\n(if you are eligible) by the census date for that semester.\nOn your invoice, SSAF and course fees are listed separately so you can easily see how much each costs.\nMore information\nFind out if you're eligible to defer your SSAF payments via\nSA-HELP\nStudent Experience Advisory Group (SEAG) Terms of Reference (PDF, 214KB)\nSSAF Steering Committee Terms of Reference (PDF, 214KB)\nAustralian Government Administration Guidelines\n2023 SSAF Annual Report (PDF, 12MB)\n2022 SSAF Annual Report (PDF, 2MB)\n2021 SSAF Annual Report (PDF, 23MB)\n2020 SSAF Annual Report (PDF, 12MB)\nSSAF Annual Student Consultation Process (PDF, 330KB)\nAcknowledgement of Country\nRMIT University acknowledges the people of the Woi wurrung and Boon wurrung language groups of the eastern Kulin Nation on whose unceded lands we conduct the business of the University.

This may include selecting and enrolling into courses that have defined requisites.\nYou may encounter several types of course requisite statements in your course guide:\nEnforced requisites\n– Students are not permitted to enrol in these courses until the prerequisite is satisfied by a pass grade in a specified RMIT course, or credit granted for the prerequisite course, or the specified corequisite is concurrently enrolled\nRecommended prior study\n– Students are expected to have completed (or demonstrate concurrent enrolment in) the specified study and may be directed to amend their enrolment if requirements are not met\nAssumed knowledge\n– The course assumes that students have specific skills or knowledge\nAll course requisites are outlined in your official\nCourse guide\n. Not all course requisites will be system enforced. The ‘enforced requisites’ will be system enforced, while ‘recommended prior study’ and ‘assumed knowledge’ are non-enforced and provide academic guidance advice for students to consider prior to enrolment.\nPlease review the information presented in your course guide to ensure your knowledge and skills are suitably matched with any course requisite statements. If you are unsure, please contact the Course Coordinator for further advice. You will be responsible for ensuring your course enrolments are correct, and manually withdrawing from any courses where the non-system enforced requisites defined in the course guide are unsuitable.\nFind course requisites in your course guide\nEnforced requisites\nEnforced course requisites are used where your success in a course is dependent on prior knowledge that must be demonstrated by successful completion of a specified RMIT course (prerequisite) or concurrent enrolment in a specified RMIT course (corequisite).\nIf the course you want to enrol in has enforced requisite/s,\nEnrolment Online\nwill prevent you from enrolling in that course if you haven’t met these requisite/s.\nEnrolment Online will permit you to conditionally enrol in a course with enforced requisite/s provided you’re enrolled in the requisite/s in an earlier semester. However, your enrolment in that course will be automatically withdrawn if you do not ultimately meet the requisite/s for that course. If this happens, you will be notified by email.\nEnforced requisite waivers\nIf you believe you have the required knowledge to successfully complete the course, you may apply for an enforced requisite waiver via\nEnrolment Online\n. You can log in to\nEnrolment Online\nwith your RMIT email address and password.\nForgotten your password? Reset it\n.\nTo be eligible for a waiver you must satisfy one of the following conditions:\nYou have completed the course/s specified in a previous requisite statement for the course\nYou have completed the course/s equivalent to the course specified in the requisite statement within the last 10 years at RMIT University. Note: in this situation you still need to apply for credit for the enforced requisite\nYou have submitted an appeal against the final grade you received for the requisite course/s\nYou have previously applied and been approved for a waiver for the requisite course/s\nYou have met the requirements other than through completing the specified RMIT course/s, e.g. completion of equivalent courses at another institution\nHow to apply for an enforced requisite waiver\nWhen you enrol in courses in\nEnrolment Online\n, the system will check that you have met all enforced requisite/s. If you haven’t, the system will alert you and present a link to apply for an enforced requisite waiver.\nYou can choose to apply for an enforced requisite waiver, or you can choose to enrol in other courses instead.\nIf you are seeking a waiver for more than one course, you will need to submit a separate waiver application for each course.\nWhat you need to apply\nYou should attach evidence that you have satisfied the requisite/s.\nExample 1: If you have completed an equivalent course at another institution within the last 10 years and you believe that course satisfies the requisite, you must attach a transcript of results and a course description (equivalent to a course guide entry) as evidence. Note: in this situation you still need to apply for credit for the enforced requisite.\nExample 2: If you have submitted an appeal against the final assessment result you have received for the enforced requisite course, you must attach evidence of your appeal.\nAfter you submit your application\nYour application will be assessed by your college/school and you will be advised of the outcome by email. You can also track the status of your application in\nEnrolment Online\n.\nAcknowledgement of Country\nRMIT University acknowledges the people of the Woi wurrung and Boon wurrung language groups of the eastern Kulin Nation on whose unceded lands we conduct the business of the University.

See the\ntimed assessments and on-campus exams page\nfor information.\nSubmitting assessments\nHow to submit your assessments\nSubmit an assessment online via Canvas\nMost assessments at RMIT can be submitted online via Canvas using Turnitin software. Submissions via Canvas include an online assessment declaration.\nGo to the\nCanvas webpage\nfor instructions on how to submit your assessments via Canvas.\nGo to Canvas webpage\nTechnical faults when submitting an online assessment\nWe understand that technical issues happen. If possible, take a screenshot of the fault or error message and record the time it happened. Send this information to your teacher to let them know you have had difficulty completing the assessment and then contact\nIT Service Connect\n. Your teacher will be in touch if you need to take further action.\nSubmit an assessment physically\nSome assessments at RMIT need to be submitted physically, such as creative works or physical artefacts. Assessments submitted physically should include a completed and signed cover sheet and declaration.\nDownload the assessment cover sheet (PDF, 498KB)\nNeed help? Download the guide (PDF, 470KB)\nIf an assessment for a specific course requires a different cover sheet, your School or educator will let you know.\nDeclaration\nAssessment declaration\nWhen you submit work for assessment, you’ll be asked to agree to the following declaration.\nDeclaration and statement of authorship\nI/we have not impersonated, or allowed myself to be impersonated by, any person for the purposes of this assessment.\nThis assessment is my/our original work and no part of it has been copied from any other source except where due acknowledgement is made.\nNo part of this assessment has been written for me/us by any other person except where such collaboration has been authorised by the lecturer/teacher concerned.\nWhere this work is being submitted for individual assessment, I declare that it is my original work and that no part has been contributed by, produced by or in conjunction with another student.\nI/we give permission for my assessment response to be reproduced, communicated compared and archived for the purposes of detecting plagiarism.\nI/we give permission for a copy of my assessment to be retained by the university for review and comparison, including review by external examiners.\nI/we understand that:\nPlagiarism is the presentation of the work, idea or creation of another person as though it is your own. It is a form of cheating and is a very serious academic offence that may lead to exclusion from the University. Plagiarised material can be drawn from, and presented in, written, graphic and visual form, including electronic data and oral presentations. Plagiarism occurs when the origin of the material used is not appropriately cited.\nPlagiarism includes the act of assisting or allowing another person to plagiarise or to copy my work.\nI/we agree and acknowledge that:\nI/we have read and understood the Declaration and Statement of Authorship above.\nIf I/we do not agree to the Declaration and Statement of Authorship in this context and a signature is not included below, the assessment outcome is not valid for assessment purposes and will not be included in my final result for this course.\nYou'll find more information about the penalties for plagiarism in the\nStudent Conduct Policy\n.\nFeedback\nAssessment feedback\nAt RMIT, teaching staff will provide you with feedback to assist in improving your performance while you study.\nYou should expect to receive progressive results and feedback within 10 working days of your assessment due date and submission. You can also request feedback if you feel it has not been provided during the stated time frame, or in one of the various formats outlined below.\nIn any course, formal and informal feedback is provided in multiple ways. Think about how you might apply assessment feedback to further develop your learning and level of achievement.\nWays you might receive feedback\nClass discussion and interaction\n– Throughout a course, there are usually opportunities for teachers and students to collaboratively discuss assessments and solutions in class or online. If you need guidance on a particular issue, then a Canvas discussion forum is a great place to ask for assistance\nRubrics and criteria\n– A rubric breaks down a set task into individual assessment criteria. Rubrics can help you take a complex assignment and break it into smaller tasks that you can check off prior to submission. Teachers will often use the rubric to structure their feedback to you by highlighting which level you achieved for each criterion. This way you can see which aspects of a task you did well on and which ones to work on. Overall, the benefits of rubrics are that they provide a clear set of goalposts for students and ensure assignments are marked consistently and fairly\nIn person (one-on-one)\n– Teaching staff are often available for informal discussion, so be sure to check in Canvas for your teachers’ availability for student consultations. Make the most of this opportunity to help improve relevant knowledge and skills for future assessment\nGroup feedback\n– Working in teams is very important in industry and so you will likely have some group assessments in your courses at RMIT. In addition to individual feedback, your teacher may provide feedback to an entire group or class. This will likely include generic discussions about the collective strengths and/or weaknesses demonstrated in the assessment\nReview & appeal a result\nReview and appeal a final course result\nIf you believe there has been an error that has impacted your final course result, you can request a review (stage 1). If the review does not resolve your issue, you may submit an appeal (stage 2).\nStudents must seek a stage 1 review of their results before submitting a stage 2 appeal.\nStage 1 – Request a review\nContact your course coordinator or program manager to request a review of your grade against one or more of the grounds stated in\nAssessment Processes 7.3\n. Stage 1 reviews must be requested within\n5 working days\nof the date of publication of the result (recommended timeframe).\nStage 2 – Submit an appeal\nIf requesting a review does not resolve your issue, you may\nsubmit an appeal\n(stage 2).\nMore information\nFor more information about reviews and appeals, see\nAppeals\nand\nAssessment Processes, Chapter 7.\nMore information\nOn-campus exams\nFind information about on-campus exams each semester.\nResults and grades\nHow to view your results, understand your grades and obtain your grade point average (GPA) or weighted average mark (WAM).\nExtensions and special consideration\nRMIT provides a number of adjustments to assessment, including extensions and special consideration. Find the adjustment for your circumstances.\nEquitable learning and disability\nAdditional support is available to ensure equal opportunities for students with a disability, long-term illness or mental health condition, and primary carers of individuals with a disability.\nAcademic integrity\nHow to use artificial intelligence (AI), reference your sources, avoid contract cheating and plagiarism, and more.\nRMIT Capabilities\nRMIT Capabilities describe the skills, knowledge and values that you will develop through your studies.\nAssessments and results\nFind out about assessment extensions, special consideration, academic integrity, academic progress, low completion rates, results and transcripts.\nAcknowledgement of Country\nRMIT University acknowledges the people of the Woi wurrung and Boon wurrung language groups of the eastern Kulin Nation on whose unceded lands we conduct the business of the University. RMIT University respectfully acknowledges their Ancestors and Elders, past and present.

TEQSA has developed the following resources for use by students, academics and teachers to promote understanding of academic integrity.\nUnderstanding academic integrity\nProtecting academic integrity\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) tools\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) and academic integrity\nArtificial intelligence (AI) tools are likely to be an integral part of future life and work. RMIT is committed to preparing our students to know how to engage and work appropriately with AI.\nYou may be guided by your educators to use AI tools in your learning, so that you can better understand possibilities and limitations and how they may be used ethically and appropriately in your future work.\nThe use of AI tools in your studies will be guided by your program and course requirements. Inappropriate use of AI in your learning and assessment could result in a breach of academic integrity. It’s always best to check with your Program Manager or Program/Course Coordinators for more information.\nRMIT may use tools to detect the use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools in assessments where AI tools are not permitted.\nWhen is it okay to use AI tools in my studies?\nYou are permitted to use AI tools like\nVal (RMIT's GenAI Chatbot)\n, ChatGPT, Midjourney and GrammarlyGO as a study aid to supplement your learning.\nFor example, you may ask questions of an AI tool to help clarify your reading interpretation or to help confirm your understanding of a topic, noting however that AI responses can be out of date, biased, not always correct, or not to be relied upon.\nAI may or may not be permitted in coursework or assessments, depending on your course requirements.\nCheck the information in the course guides and assessment task instructions to understand how AI tools can be used. If you’re unsure or if it’s not specified, ask your Program or Course Coordinator.\nAny ideas or outputs generated by AI must be referenced accurately in your academic work, otherwise it is considered plagiarism.\nThis means you must use citations crediting the tool/s where appropriate, as well as including it in your reference list – just like you would any other resource. See the Library's\nAI referencing guide\nfor specific AI referencing information.\nYou should always think critically about any content provided to you, whether from an AI tool or other sources.\nIt’s important to remember that you should always verify the content provided by AI tools. You are advised to conduct further research beyond simply asking questions of an AI tool, generating computer code, or creating images and consult with your course materials, library resources, or educator if you don't understand something or require further assistance.\nHow not to use AI\nYou cannot use AI to:\ncomplete or contribute to an assessment task when it has not been specifically allowed\nproduce ideas that you don't reference and try to pass off as your own.\nUsing AI in these ways is a breach of\nAcademic Integrity Policy\nand may have serious consequences.\nKeep drafts of your work\nTo help prove the authenticity and originality of your work, you should keep\nall draft versions\nof your work to show how your assessments were developed. These can be requested at any time during your program.\nAsk if you need help!\nWe want to support you to use AI tools legitimately and in a way that maintains your integrity and that of our academic community. If you have questions or if you are ever unsure, please speak with your teacher or Course Coordinator.\nHow to reference content generated by AI tools\nRMIT Library has developed a guide to show you how to reference content generated by AI tools.\nHow to reference AI\nContract cheating sites\nContract cheating services\nIllegal commercial (or contract) cheating services are targeting RMIT students on and around campus, and online.\nThese services offer to complete an assessment for you, sometimes asking for payment. Using these services is called contract cheating and is a breach of the Academic Integrity Policy. These services have also been known to blackmail Australian students.\nHow to identify and avoid contract cheating services\nThe\nTertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (TEQSA)\nadvises that you should always avoid any service that:\npromises to help write or improve your essay or assignment or sit an exam on your behalf in exchange for money\noffers unsolicited ‘study support’ via social media, email or on-campus advertising\nasks you to upload a previous example of your work, or materials from your course, in order to receive help\noffers to sell you study notes, exams or other assessment materials.\nTop 3 tips\nBlock unsolicited messages received via social media or email that offer study support, essay writing or other contract cheating services.\nBe aware of the information you share on social media networks and consider your privacy settings. This may help you avoid being targeted by illegal cheating service operators.\nIf you are experiencing study difficulties you should always speak with your teacher or course coordinator. They can help you access study support and ensure you understand and maintain academic integrity.\nSource:\nIdentifying, avoiding and reporting illegal cheating services\n.\nTo report a contract cheating service, or if you have any concerns or questions about contract cheating, please email\nstudent.conduct@rmit.edu.au\n.\nBreaches of academic integrity\nBreaches of academic integrity\nThere may be serious consequences for breaches of academic integrity (even accidental breaches), including the\ncancellation of results, suspension\nor\nexpulsion.\nBreaches include:\nPlagiarism\n- presenting someone else’s work or ideas as your own.\nSignificant failure to appropriately and accurately acknowledge the work of others\n, which includes the use of Artificial Intelligence algorithms.\nSelf-plagiarism\n- failure to appropriately and accurately acknowledge one’s own work where original work has been reused from previous assessment tasks (also known as self-plagiarism).\n‘Washing’\n- the use of software services to disguise plagiarism.\nContract cheating or ghostwriting\n- submitting the work of another person or from an online study platform as one’s own, or undertaking an assessment task for another person.\nCollusion or unauthorised collaboration\nin the preparation or presentation of work.\nFalsification, fabrication, manipulation or misrepresentation\nof data or results.\nAttempting to gain unfair advantage in an invigilated assessment\n, breaching the rules for the conduct of invigilated assessment in a manner that defeats or compromises the purposes of the task.\nBehaviour that violates assessment instructions\nthereby defeating or compromising the purpose of the assessment.\nUnauthorised sharing of course materials and previously submitted assessment items\nincluding via online study platforms.\nMisuse or unauthorised use of technology or equipment\n.\nReal stories of plagiarism, collusion and contract cheating\nThese are real stories of RMIT students who were penalised for plagiarism, collusion and contract cheating. Their stories are anonymous, read by former or current student volunteers.\nReal Stories of Plagiarism\nReal Stories of Plagiarism\nThis is the story of a student, read by another student in a confessional tone, who was caught plagiarising for their assessment. This video describes the consequences for such breaches of academic integrity and offers students alternatives to cheating.\nTranscript\n[Audio] For my assignment on business models, I used some of the slides from a lecture. I didn't see a\nproblem with this. The lecturer had uploaded the slides onto Canvas and made them available. The lecturer said they would be useful for this\nparticular assignment. So I took a few points from the slides and added these to my assignment. I\nassumed this was OK, and I have to admit that I copied some of the text in the slides directly and\ndidn't bother to explain in my own words. It was hard to try to paraphrase something when it was\nalready explained so well in the slides. I couldn't think of a better way to say it. Anyway,\nthe lecturer noticed that and said I should have at least referenced her slides. The lecturer also\nmentioned that other parts of my assignment were directly copied from a journal article. This was\npicked up by Turnitin. I was surprised. I didn't think Turnitin would find that stuff and it just\nfinds any quotes anyway. So what's the point? Because of this, I ended up losing 20 percent of my marks and I\ngot a warning from my course coordinator. This warning stays on my academic record. They told me\nthis was an academic integrity breach and that if anything like this happened again, I could end up\nwith a more severe penalty under the student conduct policy. I remember a student saying that\nif they stayed under a particular percentage of the Turnitin score, they wouldn't- it wouldn't\ncount as plagiarism. But unfortunately, it's still cheating. And it's unfortunate. You know, a lot of\nstudents think the same. They do it a few times, and when they're actually caught, they realize how\nmuch of a penalty it is and how so not worth it. You know, mainly because cheating is cheating.\nThere are a lot of resources available- there's library resources. And I'm pretty sure academics-\nthey're more than willing to support students with issues around plagiarism. It's always better to\nlearn as much as you can about student conduct, plagiarism, collusion and all that stuff. Once you\nget the hang of things- how to reference- once you know how it all works, what counts is stealing\nanother person's ideas and what doesn't. That goes a long way because once you practice- once you're\nin your third year, it just comes naturally. It's always good to be honest and submit what you can\non time. Better safe than sorry.\nBack to video\nReal Stories of Contract Cheating\nReal Stories of Contract Cheating\nThis is the story of a student, read by another student in a confessional tone, who was caught using a contract cheating service. This video describes the consequences for such breaches of academic integrity and offers students alternatives to cheating.\nTranscript\n[Audio] So, I was talking to a friend in the corridor after class, he'd asked me if I'd done the politics essay. I told him I hadn't yet, that I needed to do it.\nOver the weekend. I was really stressed as I hadn't even managed to find references for it, and I had to work all weekend.\nThen this other student pops into our convo and she says she'll do it for me. She said she'd done that assignment before and that it would be easy to do.\nEven said she kept get me an HD. OK, sounds like a bit of a scam. I wondered what the catch was, and she laughed and said her time doesn't come for free.\nShe said if I paid her one hundred bucks, I'd coast in with a HD.\nFirst I said, I don't get HD's so it might look a bit strange. And she goes, Yeah sure, I'll dumb it down a bit. I was a little miffed.\nShe said it would be fine. I would get good credit. I said, OK, we exchanged emails, I got her bank account details.\nI submitted the assignment and I thought it was all OK but my course coordinator asked me to meet with them to talk about my assignment.\nOh dear, busted.\nThey asked me questions about academic integrity and my assignment. I couldn't answer the questions because I hadn't done the assignment.\nAt the end of the meeting, they let me know they were going to refer us to someone called a senior officer for consideration under the student conduct policy.\nThis is how you know it's getting real. I was going to really I was really scared and really wished I hadn't paid someone to do my assignment.\nI also realized I didn't learn anything from that course, and I wonder how I'm going to progress my program. You're not. You're not. It's over.\nNot too long after that, I was invited to a hearing with a senior officer. Not only did I fail the assignment, but I failed the course.\nThis has cost me a lot because I have to pay for the course again and it delays my graduation.\nI mean, that kind of reminds me of a friend as well who was in a bit of a similar situation.\nBut they went to this like tutoring website. It seemed pretty legit. And then it kind of turned out to be a bit of a scam.\nThey kind of kept hassling them for money which is a big thing. So they ended up hearing about peer mentoring from RMIT.\nThey've got this app now called Viago and they're able to reach out to their peer mentor on Viago and just get all their questions answered.\nIt was so much more legit, totally business.\nAnd some of the hearings I've been in a pretty intense, where like, they got adjourned for three months so the cyber security team go through people's emails like it's full on like Hillary Clinton business.\nAnd then the students get in there and it's like it's - you can get through this if we like you, and if you don't lie to us.\nAnd we've got the emails, we've got the WhatsApp messages, we've got everything. And they'll just go \"I didn't do it\".\nBuddy, we see the confession. We see everything. Don't do this. But you come in and you lie and it's like, I can't help you.\nYou know, you're like - it's like the car is like, huddling towards the edge of the cliff at that point.\nThe cars in the air, the cliffs back there. Right? And I'm like throwing you a lifeline here so you can Indiana Jones it back to the cliff. Right?\nAnd if you lie in a hearing, you're cutting the rope. Like, I can't help you at that point.\nBack to video\nReal Stories of Collusion\nReal Stories of Collusion\nThis is the story of a student, read by another student in a confessional tone, who was caught colluding for their assessment. This video describes the consequences for such breaches of academic integrity and offers students alternatives to cheating.\nTranscript\n[Audio] We had a assignment about microbiology, I had chosen bacteria for my topic. My friend Discord channel mentioned she was doing bacteria too. But she was a little bit confused about assignment questions. She sometimes struggles with English sentences and she has so much pressure from her parents to pass. Same as me. I said I could help her out and uploaded my assignment on Discord so she could check it out. Boy and girl, that's not a good idea. Later, I find out that she had copied some of my assignment. I knew it would happen- which I didn't think she was going to do. I was hoping that my assignment was just to help her understand the topic. The lecturer said it was clear that we all had colluded. I didn't even know what that meant. I thought I was just helping her out. I wasn't giving it to her to cheat. Because we all had colluded, we were reported to a senior officer and invited to student contact hearings. We both ended up with penalties where we failed the assessment. I know now that I shouldn't be uploading or sharing any of my assessments, as it is an academic integrity breach. I got some experience like someone after my assignments when I was an international student. It was from my close friends, but I didn't know what they are going to do with my assignments, so I might put myself into trouble so I didn't give it to them. But after a few days, I heard my friend said she got an email from the university and she got cheated because of repeating other people's assignment. It always happens in my country when I was a student because this is not something very serious. Or like, get to that serious level. But I know the importance of if you breach the integrity in Australian universities, it might be a big issue and make you into trouble. Someone told me that a student uploaded their assignment to check and was caught because the course coordinator always go to that site every thirty minutes. And will make a list of the student's names, who uploaded their assignments and those who accessed those assignments. If I were those students, I wouldn't upload any of my assessments to public channels.\nBack to video\nLearn more\nTo find out about these (and more) breaches, complete the\nAcademic Integrity Awareness digital credential\n.\nVal GenAI Chatbot\nVal is an RMIT supported, secure and free-to-use generative artificial intelligence tool that functions just like ChatGPT.

If this happens, you'll be advised by email that you are at risk of not meeting the academic requirements of your program.\nIt’s important to remember that, throughout this process, there are many support services available to get you back on track, and people who can help you succeed.\nDownload criteria (PDF)\nThe steps of unsatisfactory academic progress\nExpand all sections\nCollapse all sections\nFirst stage at risk process\nFinal stage at risk process\nPreparing a show cause submission\nOutcomes\nFirst stage at risk process\nFirst stage at risk\nThe first time you meet one or more of the unsatisfactory academic progress criteria, you’re officially considered to be first stage 'at risk' of not meeting the academic requirements of your program.\nWhat happens then?\nYou'll get an email after results are released (or after a change to a grade) notifying you that you've been identified as first stage 'at risk'.\nIn the email, you will be invited to talk to an Academic Advisor to discuss study support and develop a tailored Academic Performance Improvement Plan (APIP). This plan sets out the requirements you need to meet in the next teaching period to continue in your program.\nIf you make unsatisfactory academic progress again in the same program, you may be identified as\nfinal stage 'at risk' of not meeting the academic requirements of your program (see the next section).\nFinal stage at risk process\nFinal stage at risk\nIf, after being identified as first stage 'at risk', you again make unsatisfactory academic progress in the same program, you may be identified as final stage 'at risk' of not meeting the academic requirements of your program.\nWhat happens then?\nYou'll get an email after results are released (or after a change to a grade) notifying you that you've been identified as final stage 'at risk'.\nIn the email, you will be invited to provide a written submission, called a show cause, to the Program Assessment Board.\nThe show cause submission is a way for you to explain your situation to the Board. Based on the information in your submission, the Board will decide if you can continue in your program. This decision will be based on whether you have a reasonable likelihood of future success in the program.\nPreparing a show cause submission\nPreparing a show cause submission\nBefore preparing your submission, you may want to consider if your current program is the right one for you, or if a break from the program would be beneficial.\nIf you decide to make a show cause submission, you need to include the following information:\nExplain why your academic progress has been unsatisfactory\nFor the teaching periods in which you’ve been identified as 'at risk', especially the most recent teaching period, you need to explain:\nwhat went wrong and why (including both academic and personal circumstances that have impaired your performance)\nhow much time each week you’ve spent in class and studying, and how much time you’ve spent on other commitments such as employment\nwhat you’ve done to resolve these issues, including any help you’ve sought\nwhat you’ve done to carry out your Academic Performance Improvement Plan.\nExplain how you intend to improve your academic performance\nYou need to explain:\nif the issues that impaired your academic performance are still present, or if your situation has improved\nif the issues are still present, how you’ll minimise their impact on your performance in the next teaching period\nyour short-term and long-term plans to improve your study skills and academic performance.\nSupporting documents\nThe Program Assessment Board will expect independent supporting documentation of any circumstances outside your control that have impaired your academic performance.\nTypical supporting documents include:\na letter or report from a health practitioner or counsellor\na death certificate or funeral notice for a close relative\na police report of a crime against you\nevidence of your use of support services recommended in your Academic Performance Improvement Plan.\nShow cause form\nThe following form can be used to help you complete your show cause submission:\nFinal stage at risk students\n–\nFinal stage show cause form\n.\nOutcomes\nOutcomes\nAfter the Program Assessment Board has considered your submission, it may decide to allow you to continue in your program, or exclude you from your program for 12 months, after which you may apply for re-admission.\nIf the Board allows you to continue in your program\nYou’ll receive a 'withdrawal of exclusion' email.\nYou’ll continue to be officially 'at risk' of not meeting the academic requirements of your program.\nYou’ll again be given the opportunity to talk to an Academic Advisor and develop an Academic Performance Improvement Plan (APIP). You’ll need to continue to meet the requirements in your APIP. If you meet one of the unsatisfactory academic progress criteria in any subsequent semesters in the same program, you may need to provide another submission to the Program Assessment Board.\nIf the Board recommends exclusion from your program\nYou will be notified of the Board's recommendation by email.\nThe Academic Registrar will be asked to exclude you from your program.\nThe Academic Registrar will notify you of the exclusion decision by email. This will take about 10 working days.\nAppeals\nYou may appeal the decision to exclude you from your program. The email from the Academic Registrar will include information about how to submit an appeal. You will need to wait to receive the email before you can proceed.\nRe-admission to your program\nYou’re eligible to apply for re-admission to the program 12 months after exclusion. You won’t automatically be re-admitted to the program from which you’ve been excluded at the end of the exclusion period. You must apply to be re-admitted through the normal application process. If you cancel your enrolment, you’ll still need to wait 12 months before applying for re-admission.\nIf you want to cancel your program\nYou must formally\ncancel your enrolment\nbefore the census date or relevant withdrawal date to avoid financial or academic penalties. Cancelling your enrolment will not stop the exclusion process.\nInternational student visas\nIf you’re studying an RMIT program on a student visa, your visa may be cancelled if you’re excluded from your program for continued unsatisfactory academic performance.\nRMIT is required by law to notify the Department of Home Affairs of any excluded students. This is in accordance with Section 19 of the Educational Services for Overseas Students Act.\nIf you’re being excluded and you cancel your enrolment, transfer to another RMIT program, or transfer to a program at another provider, RMIT is still obligated to notify the Department of Home Affairs.\nIf you appeal the decision, we won’t notify the Department of Home Affairs until the appeal process has been completed (and then only if your appeal is unsuccessful).\nIf your visa is cancelled, your status will be considered unlawful and this may affect future visa applications. For more information about your visa requirements, contact the\nDepartment of Home Affairs\n.\nContacts and support\nIf you’re worried about your results and academic progress, we recommend first talking to staff in your\nSchool or College\n. The following support services are also available.\nStudy support\nAccess expert academic advice, peer-mentoring and 24/7 online resources.\nSupport services\nOur support services are here to help you achieve your study and personal goals. If you're feeling stressed about study, we can help.\nRMIT University Student Union (RUSU)\nRUSU can provide advice about academic progress and help you prepare a show cause submission.\nAcknowledgement of Country\nRMIT University acknowledges the people of the Woi wurrung and Boon wurrung language groups of the eastern Kulin Nation on whose unceded lands we conduct the business of the University. RMIT University respectfully acknowledges their Ancestors and Elders, past and present. RMIT also acknowledges the Traditional Custodians and their Ancestors of the lands and waters across Australia where we conduct our business - Artwork 'Sentient' by Hollie Johnson, Gunaikurnai and Monero Ngarigo.\nMore information\nLibrary\nMaps\nCampus facilities\nStudent Connect\nContacts\nNew students\nEnrol as a new student\nBefore semester starts\nOrientation\nFirst weeks\nSupport\nEnrol as a new student\nBefore semester starts\nOrientation\nFirst weeks\nSupport\nMy course\nEnrolment\nCanvas\nClass timetables\nImportant dates\nFees, loans and payments\nEnrolment\nCanvas\nClass timetables\nImportant dates\nFees, loans and payments\nServices and support\nMy details and ID card\nIT support and systems\nHealth, safety and wellbeing\nInternational students\nMy details and ID card\nIT support and systems\nHealth, safety and wellbeing\nInternational students\nStudent life\nClubs and societies\nEvents and activities\nSport and fitness\nAccommodation\nClubs and societies\nEvents and activities\nSport and fitness\nAccommodation\nCareers and opportunities\nJobs, careers and employability\nInternships, work experience & WIL\nScholarships\nStudy overseas\nJobs, careers and employability\nInternships, work experience & WIL\nScholarships\nStudy overseas\nCopyright © 2025 RMIT University\n|\nTerms\n|\nPrivacy\n|\nAccessibility\n|\nWebsite feedback\n|\nComplaints\n|\nABN 49 781 030 034\n|\nCRICOS provider number: 00122A\n|\nTEQSA provider number: PRV12145\n|\nRTO Code: 3046\n|\nOpen Universities Australia\n|\nRMIT Training Pty Ltd, trading as RMIT University Pathways (RMIT UP), CRICOS Provider Code: 01912G",

This must happen before you reach 3 EFTSL (PhD) or 1 EFTSL (Masters).\nSubmit your change of program request through\nStudylink\n. A copy of your milestone outcome and any other required transfer documentation should be uploaded to the system when you submit your application.\nYou will be sent an offer letter for your new program and advised to accept your offer and enrol. International candidates studying in Australia on a student visa are also sent a new Confirmation of Enrolment (eCOE) for visa purposes.\nMasters to PhD transfer\nDiscuss your transfer application with your supervisory team (and proposed supervisory team if a change of supervisor will also occur). You usually discuss this at your Masters Confirmation of Candidature to make sure you have enough time to prepare for your PhD Confirmation of Candidature (this should be undertaken before 1 EFTSL).\nYou present your milestone review, and if it is Achieved, you submit your change of program request through\nStudylink\n. A copy of your milestone outcome and any other required transfer documentation should be uploaded to the system when you submit your application.\nYou will be sent an offer letter for your new program and advised to accept your offer and enrol. International candidates studying in Australia on a student visa are also sent a new Confirmation of Enrolment (eCOE) for visa purposes.\nPhD to Masters transfer\nDiscuss your transfer application with your supervisory team (and proposed supervisory team if a change of supervisor will also occur). This can happen at any time during candidature but generally before you reach 2 EFTSL.\nYou present your milestone review, and if it is Achieved, you submit your change of program request through\nStudylink\n. A copy of your milestone outcome and any other required transfer documentation should be uploaded to the system when you submit your application.\nYou will be sent an offer letter for your new program and advised to accept your offer and enrol. International candidates studying in Australia on a student visa are also sent a new Confirmation of Enrolment (eCOE) for visa purposes.\nProgram Transfer FAQs\nDo you need to complete a milestone to transfer at the same level?\nThis is not usually required for same level transfers; however, the proposed new School may request copies of all completed milestone documentation as part of their assessment of your transfer.\nWhat milestone do I have to complete for a Masters to PhD transfer?\nYou must complete a PhD-level Confirmation of Candidature to demonstrate that the project can be expanded in scope to PhD-level. Confirmation and Second milestone reviews have different requirements in the different programs - a Masters Second milestone is\nnot\nequivalent to a PhD Confirmation.\nWhich milestone is due next after I transfer to a PhD?\nThe Second milestone review will be the next milestone for the candidate in the PhD. The candidate must complete all three PhD-level milestones to be eligible to submit for examination.\nIf I want to transfer from a PhD to Masters, which milestone needs be completed?\nYou must complete a Masters-level milestone review to demonstrate that your project can be decreased in scope to Masters-level.\nWill my scholarship/sponsorship be extended if I transfer to a PhD program?\nNo. You must discuss your proposed transfer with your provider\nbefore\nyou submit your application/present your milestone as your scholarship/sponsorship may not apply to the new program if you complete the transfer process. If you are sponsored, you may not be permitted to transfer between programs (Masters to PhD or PhD to Masters) - you must check with your sponsor.\nRelated links\nStarting your Higher Degree by Research\nEnrolment, leave and changes to candidature\nMilestone reviews\nResponsibilities as a Researcher\nSubmission and examination\nResearch Plus program\nAction and support\nCompletion and graduation\nResearcher Portal\nAcronym glossary\nResources and support\nRelated links\nStarting your Higher Degree by Research\nEnrolment, leave and changes to candidature\nMilestone reviews\nResponsibilities as a Researcher\nSubmission and examination\nResearch Plus program\nAction and support\nCompletion and graduation\nResearcher Portal\nAcronym glossary\nResources and support\nNeed help?\nSubmit an enquiry to the School of Graduate Research\nSubmit an enquiry\nAcknowledgement of Country\nRMIT University acknowledges the people of the Woi wurrung and Boon wurrung language groups of the eastern Kulin Nation on whose unceded lands we conduct the business of the University.

They are also a great opportunity to promote research within a School and/or College.\nThe three milestones are:\nConfirmation of Candidature\nSecond Milestone Review\nThird Milestone Review.\nCompleting each milestone within the milestone window shows you are on track to a successful, timely submission for examination.\nDiscuss milestones with your supervisory team when developing a research plan at the beginning of your candidature and continue to work with your supervisory team to keep your plan up to date, considering changes to your candidature and/or research. This will help you stay on track with research and complete each milestone (and ultimately reach\nsubmission for examination\n) on time.\nExpand all sections\nWhen do I need to complete my milestones?\nYou must complete milestones within a specific window of time. It’s your responsibility to plan and present before the close of the window.\nView your milestone windows on the candidate details page in\nEnrolment Online\n(Go to My Student Records> View Research Candidature details). Your “milestone due date” is the last day of your milestone window. Plan to present well before this date.\nMilestone windows are calculated using Equivalent Full-Time Study Load (EFTSL). This ensures all candidates have the same amount of time to present their milestones, regardless of their study load or if they have changed between full-time and part-time load.\nPhD milestone windows (time after start date)\nEFTSL\nFull time\nPart time\nConfirmation of Candidature\n0.5 to 1 EFTSL\n6 to 12 months\n12 to 24 months\nSecond Milestone Review\n1.5 to 2 EFSTL\n18 to 24 months\n36 to 48 months\nThird Milestone Review\n2.5 to 3 EFTSL\n30 to 36 months\n60 to 72 months\nMasters by Research milestone windows (time after start date)\nEFTSL\nFull time\nPart time\nConfirmation of Candidature\n0.25 to 0.5 EFTSL\n3 to 6 months\n6 to 12 months\nSecond Milestone Review\n0.75 to 1 EFTSL\n9 to 12 months\n18 to 24 months\nThird Milestone Review\n1.5 to 1.75 EFTSL\n18 to 21 months\n36 to 42 months\nWhat if I don’t complete my milestone within the milestone window?\nIf you don’t complete your milestone within four weeks of the end of the milestone window, you will be nominated for action and support. Your supervisory team and your HDR Delegated Authority (HDR DA) will work with you to produce a\nCandidate Action and Support Plan (CASP)\nto help you get back on track with your research and complete your milestone.\nMilestones exemptions\nConfirmation of Candidature\nYou are only eligible for an exemption from your Confirmation of Candidature if you transferred between HDR programs at the same level. You will need to submit evidence of successfully completing your Confirmation of Candidature in the previous program. This includes candidates transferring between schools at RMIT and from other institutions.\nSecond Milestone Review\nExemptions can’t be granted for the Second Milestone Review.\nThird Milestone Review\nExemptions cannot be granted for the Third Milestone Review. However, if your enrolment has been cancelled and you are applying for readmission for the\npurpose of examination\n, you may be excused from completing this milestone providing the school is satisfied that your research is ready for examination.\nBooking your milestone\nYou will receive a reminder from the School of Graduate Research (SGR) when your milestones are due. Your supervisory team should schedule your milestone presentations for you as part of a milestone conference or, in exceptional circumstances, as a standalone presentation.\nIt is your responsibility to keep track of your milestones and be prepared to present during your milestone window. If your milestone review presentation is not scheduled by the time you receive your reminder, contact your supervisors or Research Training Services via the\nStudent Connect portal\n.\nMilestone conferences\nThe HDR milestone process has moved from local school-based events to a college-wide series of conferences. The conferences bring together HDR candidates and academic staff to support their peers and hear about the research being done across their college.\nYou will be expected to present your milestone for review at one of several milestone conferences throughout the year.\nPlease see the dates for your college below:\nCollege of Business and Law\nCollege of Design and Social Context\nSTEM College\nMilestone presentations\nEach milestone requires you to present your research to a review panel and your research community.\nYour review panel will be chaired by an experienced, research active supervisor within your school. The panel will also include your supervisors and one or more independent panel member(s). Independent panel members are RMIT supervisors with knowledge in your area of research or methodology, or individuals external to RMIT with a doctoral or equivalent qualification.\nMilestone presentations occur at Milestone Conferences, or in exceptional circumstances, at standalone presentations.\nThe presentations are a minimum of 20 minutes, with more time for questions from both your review panel and the wider audience. At the presentation, your review panel will give you feedback on your research to date, and advice and guidance for the future direction of your research. Audience members are not part of your formal progress review. However, they may give you insights and advice after your presentation.\nYou’ll be provided with your outcome and formal feedback within three weeks of your presentation.\nRequirements: Confirmation of Candidature\nYour Confirmation of Candidature marks your first significant milestone in your Higher Degree by Research (HDR) program.

You need to apply for ethics approval if your research involves humans, animals or gene modification. You need to apply for an exemption from ethics review if your research carries a lower risk to participants or the community due to certain conditions. For example, data is used in which all personal identifiers have been removed (see the\nHuman Ethics Exemption Form (PDF)\n).\nResearchers must consider the ethical risk of their human research in accordance with the\nNational Statement on Ethical Conduct of Human Research (2023)\nand\nRMIT Research Policy\n. The process at RMIT is outlined by the\nRMIT Human Research Ethics Procedure\n.\nTalk to your supervisory team as soon as possible after starting your Higher Degree by Research (HDR) to determine if you need to build ethics approval or exception into your research timeline.\nIf you do, you must apply for and obtain approval by an ethics committee or exemption from ethics review before you can collect data or complete your\nConfirmation of Candidature\n. An ethics approval or exemption request is submitted through the\nResearch Ethics Platform\n(you’ll need to request access).\nThere’s a helpful guide available in the\nResearcher Portal\nand in the\nResearch Ethics Platform\n.  That document will help you submit an application that should meet the requirements of the RMIT Human Research Ethics Procedures. This is especially important for candidates with time-critical deadlines.\nThere are two steps in the ethics process:\nGovernance review: governance reviews are usually started within three business days of your ethics approval application\nEthical review: ethical review is not started until a governance review has been completed.\nFactors that may have an impact on the turnaround times for your ethics approval include:\nthe completeness and quality of the project application\nreview category, e.g., negligible versus greater than low risk review\nnumber of project applications currently under active review\nyour response time to provide requested information\npotential wait for external documents or letters of permission for related items\nRMIT shutdown periods (i.e. public holidays, government restrictions).\nIf appropriate, you must take any relevant online module/s covering human ethics, animal ethics, and institutional biosafety.\nGen AI and your thesis\nGen AI and your thesis\nRMIT's position is that we can use\nGenerative Artificial Intelligence\n(staff login required) tools for research and innovation, but they should be engaged critically and ethically and in accordance with RMIT's established principles for the responsible conduct of research.\nWhen used appropriately, these tools offer researchers various opportunities for assisting and enhancing the research process. This includes assistance with data analysis and interpretation of results, and planning, drafting and editing text.\nWhen using Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) in thesis preparation, it is important to ensure good practice and compliance with research integrity and HDR Policy requirements (see Table 1).\nDetailed guidance about using Gen AI in your thesis and publishing is provided\nhere\n. In summary:\nYour thesis should be\nyour own work.\nAny use of Gen AI tools should be\nDeclared, attributed and acknowledged, to adhere with\nresearch integrity\nrequirements\nAny assistance in thesis writing should be supplementary only, and therefore limited to:\nInitial drafting, such as brainstorming and planning;\nMinor editorial work, such as grammar and spelling, and;\nAssistance with overall coherence and clarity.\nImages included in the thesis should be created by you.\nTable 1. HDR Policy Requirement summary\nHDR Policy\nThesis: Independent written work submitted for examination.\nHDR Submission and Examination Procedure\nSubmission declaration\n:\n‘I certify that except where due acknowledgement has been made, this research is that of the author alone; …any editorial work, paid or unpaid, carried out by a third party is acknowledged; and, ethics procedures and guidelines have been followed.\n‘Any use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in your thesis, must be ethical, responsible and in keeping with principles of academic and research integrity including honesty, transparency, fairness and accountability. Candidates will appropriately declare, attribute and acknowledge use of AI, in keeping with research integrity principles, policy and procedures for responsible authorship and publication of research outputs.’\nData management\nData management\nYou need to be aware of copyright and privacy issues that apply to your research from the earliest stages of your candidature.\nFamiliarise yourself with RMIT's\nIntellectual Property Policy\n. It will help you understand and acknowledge who owns the papers, products, reports or other work produced during your research project.\nIntellectual Property (IP) you create is by default owned by you. However, RMIT may request candidates enter into an intellectual property and/or confidentiality agreement before starting their research project.\nYou also need to understand the guidelines that\napply to authorship\nof papers and reports you might produce.\nCreative Practice research\nEthics Guidance for Creative Practice Research\nWhat is Creative Practice research?\nCreative Practice research is a broad term that refers to research based in and/or led by practice where a specific question is explored through the creative process. According to the RMIT\nResearch Policy\n, research is defined as an 'original investigation undertaken to gain knowledge, understanding or insight'.\nThe new knowledge gained may centre around reflections on theory, the nature or means of practice, and the outcomes of practice. The outcomes are highly varied and may include designs, digital media, performances, curated exhibitions, text, sound and artworks, amongst others.\nCreative Practice research may be exploratory in nature or may be research into existing practice. It can present new methods and understandings within the field of practice and lead to research outcomes that may be deemed to be ‘non-traditional’. Despite this, the principles of respect, merit and integrity, justice and beneficence outlined in the\nNational Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research\n(National Statement) also apply to any Creative Practice research that involves human participants or their data. This research is reviewed by the relevant CHEAN if it is negligible/low risk or by HREC if it is more than low risk.\nWhat are some key considerations with Creative Practice research?\na) Research method\nA Creative Practice research project, as with any other research project, may have one or multiple research methods including Creative Practice, interviews, surveys, and observations. In terms of ethics, each research method is separate and contributes to the overall data collection for the project. The Research Ethics Platform (REP) has descriptions of each research method and the appropriate method/s should be selected for the research component of the Creative Practice research.\nb) Participants/contributors/models\nCreative Practice research can involve contributors, models, and participants. The difference between these three depends on the data being collected in relation to the research. Participants are people whose opinions, lifestyles, views etc. are relevant to and the focus of the research. These views are collected as data and analysed to assist in answering the research question. As such, participants generally need to complete a Participant Information and Consent Form (PICF) prior to participating in the research.\nContributors and models are defined as people whose opinions, lifestyles, personal background, history or any other personal trait or opinion are not relevant to the research\n.\nTheir contribution may support the research or contribute to it in a professional manner, but it is not the focus of the research. This contribution should be agreed upon via a memorandum of understanding or contract. Contributors and models can also be participants, but their respective roles need to be clearly distinguished and outlined. For Creative Practice research, considerations include:\nDetermine whether people involved in the project are contributors, models or participants.\nWhat level of consent and/or agreement is required for each group.\nWhat data is being collected and how it will be managed.\nc) Data collection and management\nData’ refers to any information that is collected from participants to be analysed and that contributes to answering the research question. This may include survey results, interview responses, creative outputs, and notes. The RMIT Research Data Management Procedure outlines the responsibilities of researchers with respect to research data management in accordance with Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research (2018).\nResearchers have a responsibility to retain clear, accurate and complete records of all research including research data and primary materials to a sufficient standard that allows for verification and/or reproduction of research by others.\nFor Creative Practice research, considerations include:\nHow will data be collected from participants and how will it be stored, particularly with creative outputs?\nHow will informed consent be recorded and retained for the retention period?\nWhat data will be collected to ensure that clear, accurate and complete records are retained that will enable research to be verified or replicated?\nHow will data be shared amongst the research team, particularly with audio, visual, or media outputs?\nd) Voluntary and informed consent\nVoluntary and informed consent flows from the principle of respect for human beings includes respect for their capacity to make their own decisions, such as not to participate.\nParticipants must be appropriately informed of the research before consenting to participate.\nIn Creative Practice, consent can be difficult to obtain or impractical, particularly if participants are part of an audience, so consideration needs to be given to how consent will be obtained, if it will be obtained or if a waiver of consent is warranted. Chapter 2.3 of the National Statement provides details about when a waiver of consent can be considered.\nSome considerations include:\nWhether signing and returning a consent form is the most appropriate method of obtaining consent.\nProtocol for how the researcher will determine capacity to give consent and verify participant inclusion criteria.\nHow participants will be informed of the research and consent will be recorded.\nHow participants can withdraw their consent.\ne) Level of risk\nResearchers are responsible for assessing the risk level of their proposed research activity and determining if anticipated benefits of the research outweigh the risks associated with it.\nFor Creative Practice research, additional considerations may include:\nThe sensitivity of the research data being collected and the confidentiality of the participants.\nThe potential participants and whether the targeted participants are a vulnerable group as outlined in the National Statement and how this will be determined in a Creative Practice environment.\nThe potential for psychological risk and how this will be determined.\nThe potential for physical risk depending on what participation in the research involves.\nProtocols for participants to withdraw their participation from the research. This is particularly important in a Creative Practice environment where the ‘data’ could include contributing to creative outputs.\nKey things to remember when completing the ethics application\nWhile the project may be ‘Creative Practice research’, the research method is not necessarily Creative Practice but may be a combination of several research methods.\nDistinguish between contributors, models and participants within the project. Contributors and models can also be participants, but their roles need to be clearly defined.\nIdentify how participants will be informed of the research and provide consent to participate as well as how they will be able to withdraw their participation.\nDetermine what data is being collected, how it is being collected, and how it will be managed.\nAdditional resources\nBolt, B.

It may include more frequent meetings with your supervisory team, referral to academic or wellbeing support services or making variations to your candidature.\nYou may self-identify that you need additional support. Alternatively, your supervisory team or your\nHDR Delegated Authority (HDR DA)\nmight nominate you for action and support. Your supervisory team and HDR DA will work with you to produce a Candidate Action and Support Plan (CASP).\nA CASP is designed to help you get back on track to complete your research.\nExpand all sections\nWhy was I nominated for action and support?\nYour supervisory team or HDR DA may nominate you for action and support if you:\nare facing research delays\nneed extra support to complete a milestone\nhave circumstances in your research or personal life that could negatively affect your research.\nSee clauses 17 – 20 of the\nHDR Progress Management and Support Procedure\nfor specific situations requiring action and support.\nWhat happens if I'm nominated for action and support?\nYou’ll be invited to attend an action and support meeting to discuss your situation and identify the support that will benefit you the most. This may include:\nSchool-based support, such as more frequent supervisory meetings, increasing the hours you spend on your research or regular meetings with the HDR DA.\nMaking variations to your candidature, such as:\ntemporarily or permanently\nchanging to part-time load\ntaking a\nleave of absence\nreviewing your\nsupervisory arrangements\napplying for an extension to your candidature (if you are close to your submission date).\nReferrals to\nRMIT support services\n, such as wellbeing services or academic support services.\nThis support will be documented in a Candidate Action and Support Plan (CASP). During the meeting your Supervisory team and HDR DA will work with you to\ncomplete a CASP form and action plan\n. Together they form the CASP, specifying the tasks for you and your supervisory team and the dates for their completion.\nThe CASP will be in place for up to 3 months for full-time candidates or 6 months for part-time candidates.\nRead the instructions for completing your\nCASP form and action plan\nbefore your meeting.\nYou can seek support and advice from\nRMIT University Student Union (RUSU) Student Rights service\nand any other relevant\nsupport services\nbefore the meeting. You can also have a support person at the meeting.\nWhat happens if I can’t attend an action and support meeting or contribute to my CASP?\nIf you can’t attend your action and support meeting at the scheduled time, email your Supervisors,\nHDR DA\nor the Research Training Services (RTS) team as soon as possible. Your action and support meeting can be rescheduled to a more suitable time. The meeting can also be held online ,via Teams  if you are unable to attend in person.\nThe action and support process is designed to help you and address issues and challenges you may be facing. If you don’t attend your action and support meeting, it will go ahead in your absence and your supervisory team and HDR DA will develop your CASP without your input and you will be expected to accept the recommendations in your CASP and complete the tasks assigned to you in the action plan.\nWhat happens at the end of the action and support period?\nThe end date of your action and support period is  recorded on your CASP. It must be within three months of the start of your CASP for full-time candidates or six months for part-time candidates.\nAt the end of your CASP, your HDR DA will review your progression of the tasks in your action plan. They’ll decide if:\nYou are making satisfactory progress, and no longer need action and support.\nYou need an additional period of action and support. A CASP meeting will be scheduled with your supervisors and HDR DA to develop a new CASP.\nYou have not made satisfactory progress. Your HDR DA will refer the matter to your College for review. See the section on\nWhat are the College review and RCPC processes?\nWhat are the College review and RCPC processes?\nCollege review\nDuring a College review your College will look at all documentation related to your candidature and progress. This includes your milestone documentation, CASPs and supervisory meeting minutes. They’ll decide if you’ve been given the support you needed. In some circumstances, the College may ask you to attend a confidential meeting as a part of the review process.\nIf your College decides you haven’t been provided with appropriate support, they’ll recommend a further period of action and support.\nIf your College decides you’ve been provided with appropriate support, they’ll recommend you attend a Research Candidate Progress Committee (RCPC) meeting to discuss your progress further.\nResearch Candidate Progress Committee (RCPC)\nIf you are referred to RCPC, your College will invite you to attend a RCPC meeting to discuss your progress.\nThese meetings are convened by your College. The committee includes a Chair (from your College), your HDR DA and an independent academic (a senior academic from another school in your College – usually another HDR DA). Your College will also invite others to attend the RCPC meeting (including your supervisors and sometimes the School of Graduate Research). However, they don’t form part of the committee.\nWe encourage you to bring a support person with you to your RCPC meeting.\nTo prepare for the meeting:\nYour College will ask you to make a written submission to the committee. We strongly advise you submit this. It’s your opportunity to tell the committee about your situation, any issues you’ve experienced and how you plan to continue your research within the time you have left.\nSeek support and advice from the\nRMIT University Student Union (RUSU) Student Rights service\nand any other relevant\nsupport services\n.\nRead the\nHDR Policy\n,\nHDR Progress Management and Support Procedure\nand\nHDR Unsatisfactory Progress Process\n.\nContact Research Training Services via the\nRMIT Connect portal\nfor advice and with any other questions you might have.\nThe RCPC will make a recommendation to the Associate Deputy Vice Chancellor, Research Training and Development (ADVC RT&D).

You can use the\nExpectation and Boundary Setting Tool (PDF, 442KB)\nto assist these conversations. There is also a\nResearch Publication and Authorship Plan (PDF, 295KB)\nto guide you in discussing your future research outputs.\nSuccess depends on everyone meeting their responsibilities - including you - as the driver of your research project. This means developing good habits, such as producing work you’ve agreed upon within a specified timeframe, giving your supervisory team adequate time to review your work before your meetings and having a clear idea of what you need to achieve at each meeting.\nDon't go “offline” if you are struggling with workload or grappling with research questions. This is part of the process and your supervisors are best placed to give you guidance on how to resolve these kinds of issues.\nYour Senior Supervisor(s) will advise and assist you in:\nreading and providing feedback about your work\nproviding guidance on developing your research skills\nmeeting the requirements for successfully completing your\nmilestone reviews\nthe timely submission of your research for examination\nsign off on compliance and administrative matters, including\nchanges to candidature\nand applications for\nleave of absence\n.\nThe\nHDR Progress Management and Support Procedure\nand\nSupervision Code of Practice (PDF, 72KB)\nspecifies responsibilities in the supervisory arrangement.\nRoles within your supervisory team\nRoles within your supervisory team\nThe different types of supervisors are:\nSenior/Joint Senior Supervisor - the role of Senior Supervisor must be held by an RMIT staff member\nAssociate Supervisors - candidates may also have one or more Associate Supervisors.\nIf your area of research requires a supervisor external to RMIT, they can take the role either of Associate Supervisor or share the Senior Supervisor role as a Joint Senior Supervisor.\nA percentage-based weighting system is used to identify the respective contributions of each supervisor. Percentage allocations can be changed if the needs of the candidate or supervisors change.\nThe most common weightings for two supervisors is 70% Senior Supervisor and 30% Associate Supervisor. Other weightings are possible, as long the Senior Supervisor(s) have a minimum load of 35% and a higher load than any Associate Supervisors, who must have a minimum load of 10%.\nEnsuring quality supervision\nEnsuring quality supervision\nRMIT has a\nregistration\nsystem for HDR supervisors to make sure you get the best possible support and ensure compliance with the national\nHigher Education Standards Framework\n.\nThe\nSupervision Code of Practice (PDF, 72KB)\noutlines the key principles for best practice.\nTo be eligible for registration, Senior and Joint Senior Supervisors must be research active and have a PhD (or equivalent) and Associate Supervisors must have a Higher Degree by Research. This doesn’t apply to external supervisors because they’re typically appointed for their industry expertise.\nThe eligibility of all supervisors is reviewed every two years.\nChanging supervision arrangements\nChanging your supervision arrangements\nTo request a\nchange in your supervision team\n, discuss this with your current and proposed supervisory team and your HDR Delegated Authority (HDR DA). Your Senior Supervisor must submit a change of supervisory arrangement request via the Supervisor Intranet.\nIf you have any questions, please contact the Research Training Services Team via the\nStudent Connect Portal\n.\nRecords of supervision meeting\nRecords of supervision meetings\nIt is good practice to keep a record of the meetings you have with your supervisory team, as this will help you to manage your tasks and deadlines in a structured manner. We recommend that the following information is documented for each of your supervisor meetings:\ndate\nname(s) of supervisor(s) present\nyour next milestone review (confirmation of candidature, second milestone review, third milestone review)\nfeedback provided by the supervisor on the work presented and directions moving forward\nlist of tasks that you will undertake in preparation for the next meeting\nlist of tasks that your supervisor will undertake in preparation for the next meeting\nany factors with the potential to impact on the timely and effective achievement of the next milestone or submitting for examination\nany other matters to be documented\na proposed date for the next meeting.\nOnce documented, please share this record with your supervisor team via email.\nRelated links\nStarting your Higher Degree by Research\nEnrolment, leave and changes to candidature\nMilestone reviews\nResponsibilities as a Researcher\nSubmission and examination\nResearch Plus program\nAction and support\nCompletion and graduation\nResearcher Portal\nAcronym glossary\nResources and support\nRelated links\nStarting your Higher Degree by Research\nEnrolment, leave and changes to candidature\nMilestone reviews\nResponsibilities as a Researcher\nSubmission and examination\nResearch Plus program\nAction and support\nCompletion and graduation\nResearcher Portal\nAcronym glossary\nResources and support\nNeed help?\nSubmit an enquiry to the School of Graduate Research\nSubmit an enquiry\nAcknowledgement of Country\nRMIT University acknowledges the people of the Woi wurrung and Boon wurrung language groups of the eastern Kulin Nation on whose unceded lands we conduct the business of the University.

They can also expand your professional network and open new career opportunities.\nThe most common models of industry engagement are:\n3-6 month short placements\n2-4 year embedded research/collaborations.\nYou can do a placement once you have your Confirmation of Candidature, or while you are under examination but have not yet submitted your archival thesis.\nIn order to undertake a placement, you must be achieving\nsatisfactory academic progress\nand not have exceeded\nmaximum candidature duration\n.\nAny industry engagement that contributes to your Higher Degree by Research must be endorsed by your supervisor.\nExpand all sections\nHow do I find an industry placement?\nYou can find short placements in the Weekly HDR Bulletin e-newsletter, through\nAPRIntern\n, or by browsing websites of organisations relevant to your research.\nYou and your supervisor can also set up a short placement through your professional networks and relationships.\nIt’s important to involve your supervisor in initial discussions with potential partners. Your supervisor will help ensure your placement complies with RMIT requirements.\nHow do I get my placement approved?\nAny industry engagement that contributes to your Higher Degree by Research must be endorsed by your supervisor.\nDiscuss possible placements with your RMIT supervisor\nbefore\nyou engage with a partner.\nYour supervisor will make sure the placement:\nfits into your program\nis articulated in your research plan\nis reviewed at each milestone review\nis covered by a formal written agreement that defines things like supervision, financial arrangements and intellectual property.\nHow should I prepare for a placement?\nWe recommend you complete the\nmoderated online Research Plus modules\nrelated to workplace culture and career development, to help prepare for your industry engagement.\nRMIT created these modules to help HDR candidates be work-ready and carry out the roles they have studied for.\nWho will supervise me during a placement?\nDepending on your placement, you may be jointly supervised by both RMIT and external supervisors.\nClear communication with your RMIT supervisor and external supervisor or research partner is essential for a successful experience and strong industry partnerships into the future.\nAt the start of the placement:\nMeet with your RMIT supervisor and external supervisor to work out timelines and deliverables.\nDuring the placement:\nMeet regularly with your RMIT supervisor to discuss your progress, seek feedback and check the placement is going to plan.\nParticipate in three-way meetings with your RMIT supervisor and external supervisor to seek and provide feedback and to review timelines and deliverables.\nWho owns any intellectual property I create during a placement?\nIt is common for candidates to create intellectual property during their industry engagement. Details of who owns this intellectual property must be negotiated before the placement starts and be included in a formal written agreement. You can read more about how IP is managed at RMIT on the\nResearcher Portal\nat\nUnderstanding Intellectual Property (IP)\n.\nCan I take a leave of absence during a placement?\nYou should only take leave of absence during your industry engagement in exceptional circumstances.\nReasons for not taking leave of absence during industry engagement include:\nCandidates have a\nmaximum leave of absence entitlement of 12 months during their candidature\n.

There may be exemptions where you are enrolling in your final course to complete your program.\nIf you’ve been prevented from adding an online class in Enrolment Online and are in your final semester of study or enrolled in a face-to-face class running at the same time, you may apply to enrol by submitting a request via the\nStudent Connect portal.\nSubmit a request\nProgram gaps\nStudent visa holders have a maximum of eight weeks break between programs.

Make sure you understand your visa conditions and work restrictions.​\nFor more information, see\nwork while studying\n.\nYour rights as an international student\nAustralia’s laws promote quality protection and consumer protection for international students.

You’ll find the credit point allocation of each course listed in the\ncourse guide\n.\nMost\nvocational education students\n(certificate I-IV and diploma programs) will automatically be enrolled in a full-time enrolment load based on their program enrolment.\nYou must generally enrol in\nat least one course in Semester 1 and Semester 2\nas these are compulsory terms for most programs. You can also choose to enrol in courses in the optional Spring/Summer Semester and/or flexible terms.\nHow do I check my enrolment load?\nYou can view your current enrolment load by checking your\nStatement of Enrolment\nin\nEnrolment Online\n. Any time you change your enrolment (add or drop classes) your statement will be updated within 24 hours to reflect your current enrolment.\nYour statement will show your enrolment divided into two study periods:\nfirst half of the year, showing all enrolment between January to June; and\nsecond half of the year, showing all enrolment between July to December\nIf you are enrolled full-time for the study period, your\n'Aggregated Load'\nwill be\n'100% of a Full Load'\n.\nIf your Aggregated Load is less than 100% of a Full Load you are\nNOT\nenrolled at a full-time load and need to add more classes via Enrolment Online.\nLog in to Enrolment Online\nCan I apply to reduce my enrolment load (study part-time)?\nStudent visa holders can only reduce their enrolment load (study part-time) on grounds of\ncompassionate and compelling circumstances\n.\nCompassionate and compelling circumstances are defined as circumstances outside a student’s control that impact the student’s ability to study. See the\ncompassionate and compelling circumstances\npage for examples and evidence requirements.\nDeadline to apply\nIf your circumstances have changed and you may not be able to study full-time you should seek urgent advice from your Program Manager or College Academic Services team. You must do this as soon as possible to allow time for advice and approval to amend your enrolment before your class\ncensus date/s\n.\nYour class census dates are shown on your\nStatement of Enrolment\nand in\nEnrolment Online\n.\nYou should\nNOT\nchange your enrolment until\nafter\nyou have received formal approval to reduce your enrolment load (see application process below). If you reduce your enrolment load without approval, RMIT may reject your application and you may not be issued with a new CoE.\nIf you have been approved to reduce your enrolment load you must ensure you drop relevant classes before the census date to avoid financial liability.\nHow to apply to reduce your enrolment load\nIf you feel you meet compassionate and compelling circumstances and you wish to apply for a reduced load, you must:\nContact your Program Manager or\nCollege\nto discuss your situation as soon as possible\nPlease note:\nYou should\nNOT\nchange your enrolment as you must continue to remain enrolled in a full-time load until you have formal approval to reduce your enrolment load\nAfter discussion with your Program Manager or College, download and complete the\nApplication to Reduce Enrolment Load Form (PDF, 526KB)\nSubmit your completed form and evidence to support your application to\nStudent Connect\n.\nIf your application is approved, you may then reduce your enrolment by dropping classes in Enrolment Online.\nApply to Reduce Enrolment Load Form (PDF, 526KB)\nNeed help?\nFor more information, please contact\nStudent Connect\n.\nRelated links\nCompassionate and compelling circumstance\nProve your enrolment\nChanges to your study plans\nApply for a new COE\nStatus and details\nLast updated August 2022\nBy Academic Registrar's Group (ARG)\nIn accordance with National Code 2018 Standard 7, Standard 8, Standard 9\nAcknowledgement of Country\nRMIT University acknowledges the people of the Woi wurrung and Boon wurrung language groups of the eastern Kulin Nation on whose unceded lands we conduct the business of the University.

RMIT respectfully acknowledges their Ancestors and Elders, past and present. RMIT also acknowledges the Traditional Custodians and their Ancestors of the lands and waterways across Australia where we conduct our business.\nAt RMIT we recognise and respect the unique culture and contribution that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people bring to our communities. The RMIT Community is committed to the work of acknowledging the histories and experiences of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Through Responsible Practice, we strengthen the relationships between RMIT and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, to the benefit of all Australians and our global community. We are also proud to provide study, cultural, and personal support to our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students in their learning journey.\nOur commitment to Responsible Practice\nRMIT’s university strategy\nKnowledge with Action 2031\ncontains five Indigenous Strategic Commitments that support the university in its journey of Responsible Practice. These commitments focus on Indigenous Staff, Indigenous Students, Indigenous Knowledges: Research and Learning and Teaching, Community Engagement, and Responsible Practice.\nIndigenous Student Success Strategy\nWe are committed to empowering Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander learners and professionals as part of a distinctive learning ecosystem. The Ngarara Willim Centre and the Office of Indigenous Education, Research and Engagement has collaborated with Indigenous communities, learners, academic and professional staff, and leadership to create\nRMIT's first Indigenous Student Success Strategy (PDF 4 MB)\n. The strategy aims to create a more inclusive and culturally safe environment where Indigenous learners can thrive academically, culturally, and socially.\nRMIT Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Employment Plan\nTo ensure achievement and sustained success, RMIT will build the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Tertiary Education Workforce through fair and open recruitment. RMIT’s organisational development and talent teams are guiding this work through the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Future Workforce Strategy 2021–2025​ and\nRMIT Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Employment Plan 2024–2026 (PDF 3.7 MB)\n.\nOur dedicated education centre\nOur Indigenous Education Centre is called the Ngarara Willim Centre. The Centre’s name means ‘gathering place’ in the Victorian Aboriginal language of Wurundjeri. The Centre is a gathering place for our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students and staff. It is also a place for the university community to gain a better appreciation for Indigenous culture, business and knowledge. Find out more about the services and experiences\nNgarara Willim Centre\nhas to offer or find us on campus.\nRMIT Indigenous Education Statements\n2023 RMIT Indigenous Education Statement (PDF 392 KB)\n2022 RMIT Indigenous Education Statement (PDF 345 KB)\n2021 RMIT Indigenous Education Statement (PDF 338 KB)\n2020 RMIT Indigenous Education Statement (PDF 321 KB)\n2019 RMIT Indigenous Education Statement (PDF 177 KB)\n2018 RMIT Indigenous Education Statement (PDF 8.6 MB)\n2017 RMIT Indigenous Education Statement (PDF 4.8 MB)\nFind out about Indigenous sites at RMIT\nEmployment opportunities\nExplore what opportunities we have to offer, and start your journey with RMIT.\nJoin the team\nAcknowledgement of Country\nRMIT University acknowledges the people of the Woi wurrung and Boon wurrung language groups of the eastern Kulin Nation on whose unceded lands we conduct the business of the University.

It also includes links to other terms and policies about how RMIT operates, including on things like privacy and intellectual property.\n1. Studying with us\nRMIT offers a range of different courses and programs, including short courses, single courses, micro credentials, and undergraduate (certificates, diplomas and bachelor degrees) and post graduate (bachelor honours, graduate diplomas and certificates, masters and doctorates) award qualifications (\nCourses\n).\nThe range of our Courses means that different terms and conditions may apply, depending on features such as:\nhow the Course is taught and how you study, as well as whether third parties or other industry bodies are involved in providing the Course;\nwhether you are an Australian or International student;\nwhat kind of qualification it is, and whether it is an award or accredited Course (eg leading to a degree); and\nhow the Course is paid for (including if you receive government funding, such as HECS-HELP, FEE-HELP or VET Student Loans).\nThese terms here set out some of the conditions applying to your relationship with RMIT, however, depending on the Course and your status as a domestic or overseas student, specific terms will apply in relation to fees, cancellations, leave of absence, transfers or deferrals and other important matters.\nIn addition to these terms, a number of policies apply to you when studying with RMIT. These Policies are\nhere\n. Our Policies may be updated from time to time, and we may develop new policies. We will publish new policies and any updates on this website.  Where appropriate, we will notify you of important changes to policies, either by email, with a notice on our site, or as an item in our news section.  We recommend you check our site regularly for any updates, as they will apply to you from the time they are updated.\n2. Fees\nAll Course fees are published as indicative estimates, and should only be used as a guide. Our fees typically increase each year and may change without notice.\nThe total amount you will pay for a Course will vary, depending on:\nthe subjects you choose to study (as some subjects have higher fees than others);\nwhether you receive any government funding or assistance (such as HECS-HELP, FEE-HELP or VET Student Loans);\nwhether you’re required to pay for other fees and expenses related to your Course, such as field trips, equipment and textbooks;\nyour study load and the time it takes you to complete the Course; and\nwhether you receive any approved credit for prior learning.\n3. Third party and industry involvement\nIn delivering our Courses, we may partner with different organisations to enhance our students’ learning experience. To do so, it may be a requirement of undertaking a Course that students agree to provide their personal information to one of our partner organisations, or to comply with additional terms and conditions.\nFor some of these Courses, you may not be able to enrol in or complete it without agreeing to the third party terms. Where it is required, when you enrol in a Course supported by a third party, you are taken to agree to those party’s terms and conditions, as well as their privacy policies.  Otherwise, you will be taken to agree to those party’s terms and conditions when you use the particular service or function (eg chat subject forums, or calendar booking functions).\nThese third parties may be based overseas in countries like the USA or Canada, as well as countries in Asia (eg China, India, Singapore) and Europe (eg UK, Spain).  Some of our current third party partners and providers include:\nSlack\nprovides a chat forum/channel for student/tutor subject discussions.  See Slack’s\nterms and privacy policy\n.\nCalendly\nprovides a function to book appointments to speak with tutors and Course facilitators.  See Calendly’s\nterms\nand\nprivacy policy\n.\nZOOM\ncloud meetings to enable class participation. See ZOOM’s\nterms and privacy policy\n.\nOpen Universities Australia (OUA)\nprovides a platform through which certain RMIT online Courses are provided.  See OUA’s\nprivacy policy\n.\nUdacity\nprovides Course content for certain specialist online Courses. See Udacity’s\nterms and privacy policy\n.\nCredly\nprovides a badge or digital credential in respect of a Course you have completed, which you can post on your professional networking profile.  See Credly’s\nterms\nand\nprivacy policy\n.\nThe University uses the Microsoft Office 365 suite of applications for student email accounts (Outlook), and online meetings, as well as other collaboration tools (eg Teams).\nFurther, some product-specific Courses which, for example, teach you how to use a particular software program or other tool, will involve you obtaining a trial or limited access licence to that software or tool. This will also be subject to the relevant company’s terms of use and privacy policy which will be available on their website.\nWhere it is not a requirement of enrolling in or completing a Course, we will let you know about the third party partners involved in a Course, and provide you with an opportunity to decide whether you want to provide them your personal information.\n4. Student intellectual property\nRMIT’s policy regarding intellectual property (\nIP\n) is available from our\npolicy library\n. For audit and record keeping purposes, and in compliance with our obligations regarding document retention, RMIT will keep copies of works in which students own the IP, which were created in the Course of their studies with us.  This may include written essays, exams and other assessment pieces, as well as photos, artworks, garments, audio-visual recordings and designs.  By retaining a record of student work, RMIT does not obtain any ownership or exclusivity rights in relation to it - simply a licence to retain a copy for a period of 7 years after its assessment. Students still own their work in accordance with the IP Policy.\nRMIT will seek students’ permission to use copies or records of students and their work for:\nfurther educational purposes, including teaching and learning in other Courses;\npromotional or publicity purposes; or\nspecific archiving purposes, such as creating a retrospective of RMIT student work, for a period longer than 7 years.\n5. Our websites\nWe operate a number of websites as part of our Courses and services (\nsites\n). By accessing one of our sites, you agree to these terms.\nContent\nThe content on our sites includes things like text, code, software, video, music, sound, graphics, photographs, illustrations, artwork, names, logos, trade marks, service marks and other material which is protected by intellectual property laws (eg copyright, patents, and registered trade marks and designs), as well as other legal rights and actions. The sites include content which we own or control, as well as content which is owned or controlled by other parties, which we licence.\nLinks\nIf our sites contain links to other third party websites, your access to those sites will be covered by terms between you and the other operator of those pages. We don’t control what’s on those pages or in any third party content online. We are not responsible for any of their content, including links or other functionality like e-commerce. If our site contains a link to a third party web page, it’s not necessarily an endorsement by us of that third party, their page or their products or services. If you have questions or concerns about those third party pages or content, you should contact the relevant owner or operator of that page.\nYou can link to our sites in a way that is fair and legal and does not damage our reputation or take advantage of it. You cannot link, frame, refer to, or post your own material to, or otherwise use the site, or our services, in a way which incorrectly suggests any form of association, approval or endorsement by us, or in a way which would be misleading or deceptive, or likely to mislead or deceive.\nPosting your material to our sites\nSome parts of our site may be interactive, or allow you to post comments, or your own content such as images, text or videos. This also includes our social media sites. Certain parts of our site and our social channels (including the interactive parts) may be operated by a third party or using third party technology, which also have separate terms and conditions applying to your use of or access to them.\nBy submitting your material to the site you warrant you are its sole author; the material is not false or misleading; and, it does not infringe any person’s intellectual property rights, or any other applicable laws.\nWhen you submit your own material to one of our sites you grant us (and our affiliates) a royalty-free, world-wide, sub-licensable, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, transferable licence to use, copy, reproduce, modify, edit, alter, create derivative works from, commercialise, publish, and perform the material.\nIf your posted material depicts another person, you need to have their permission before you submit it, and you confirm they agree to have it dealt with in accordance with these terms and our\nPrivacy Statement\n.\nWe don’t monitor the sites continuously: if you see behaviour or content which is not acceptable or which doesn’t comply with these terms or our polices, please tell us via our\nwebsite form\n, or the relevant direct message function if it’s a social media site. We may remove or edit any content or material you post (material) from the site in our discretion.\nYou must not use the site, or an activity to publish or send malicious content (such as phishing, viruses, harmful code or Trojans), with the intent to compromise our or a user’s account, security, identity, IT environment or to breach confidentiality. You must not use the site to publish or send spam (unsolicited commercial electronic messages), or any other commercial communications. You may not use the site for any unlawful purposes, fraud, or to conduct or promote illegal activities. You must not infringe our or another person’s intellectual property.\nThe content on our sites includes things like text, code, software, video, music, sound, graphics, photographs, illustrations, artwork, names, logos, trade marks, service marks and other material which is protected by intellectual property laws (eg copyright, patents, and registered trade marks and designs), as well as other legal rights and actions. The sites include content which we own or control, as well as content which is owned or controlled by other parties, which we licence.\n6. Our events and activities\nWhen you’re attending one of our events or activities, you must follow our reasonable directions – including instructions about safety matters. You must not do anything which would cause us (or other users or attendees) to be in breach of a law or regulation. You must not cause any damage to property or systems; and you must not injure other people. You will take reasonable care of yourself and responsibility for your own health. You will also take reasonable care in interacting with other users, attendees, and participants, as well as the assets and resources provided at the event venue.\nWe (or the venue) may refuse entry to an activity for any reason, including where a ticket hasn’t been acquired from an authorised channel. For paid ticketed events, we may not be able to refund or exchange tickets, except as required by law. The issuing of tickets to our events is also subject to the terms and conditions of the booking or ticketing platform we use.\nWe always aim for events to run smoothly, however, sometimes things don’t go as planned. We reserve the right to add, withdraw, reschedule, vary or substitute prices, prizes, venues, offerings, speakers and audience capacity at activities. Your admission to an activity is also subject to any terms and conditions which the venue applies, including about things like smoking or consumption of alcohol, or access to certain areas of a premises.\nPhotos and recordings at events or activities\nWhen you attend RMIT official events or activities you may be photographed or recorded. By attending, you consent to us taking those photos or recordings. If you don’t want us to take any photos or recordings, let our photographers know, and we will take reasonable steps not to include you in the photos or recordings. However, we can’t guarantee that we will be able to crop you out of everything, and you may still appear incidentally or in the background of recordings or photos we take. We may use the photos and recordings for our own purposes, including marketing purposes and on our sites. As part of this, we may edit them however we need.\nWe may also provide the photos and recordings to our related industry partners or event partners for their use as well. Notwithstanding our Privacy Statement, we will own all rights in the photos and recordings we take at our activities, and you waive any rights you may have in them, and you consent to the use and publication and disclosure of the photos and recordings we take. By attending the activity, you agree to this, as it is a condition of entry or participation.\nFurther, our properties (as well as the venues where we hold events) are fit out with security monitoring systems, which will capture footage as well as other potentially personally identifying information (eg CCTV, or on access cards or other systems). These systems are an important way through which we provide a safe environment for all students, staff, alumni and other members of the public.\n7. General\nNothing in these terms affects any warranties or liabilities which cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law.

In no event will we or any of our affiliates, licensors, service providers, employees, agents, officers or directors be liable for damages or any kind (including under contract, tort or negligence), arising out of or in connection with your use (or inability to use) the site, or any websites linked to it, any content on the site, or any activities or events, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, consequential or punitive damages, which includes, but is not limited to personal injury, pain and suffering, emotional distress, loss or revenue or profits or business or anticipated savings, loss of use or goodwill, loss of data, even if such loss was foreseeable (\nloss\n).\nNeither us nor our partners involved in the site or activities will be liable for any loss you incur in connection with the site or activities.

It may not be compatible with your device, internet access type or limits, or browser.\nWe will do our best in light of technical constraints, but we can’t warrant that the site or content is free from viruses, worms, harmful code, Trojans, or similar, or that it will be free from hacks, denial of service attacks; and we are not liable for any damage or losses you might incur as a result of any of these.\nGiven we do not continuously monitor all site activities, we are not responsible for content provided by third parties – including other students, staff, alumni or other visitors.\nThese terms are governed by the laws of Victoria, Australia. If any of these terms are or become invalid, at our option, the relevant part is severed or to be read down; and doesn’t affect the validity of the remaining parts. Neither of us, nor you, is (or can you represent yourself to be) an employee, partner, agent or other authorised representative of the other. A waiver has to be in writing and signed.

By prioritising both digital and physical accessibility, we aim to promote equity and remove barriers for people with a disability, long-term illness or mental health condition. We are committed to ensuring our web content and digital systems comply with the\nWeb Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2.2 level AA\n.\nInclusive by Design: Our IDEA Framework\nOur Inclusion,\nDiversity, Equity and Access (IDEA) Framework\ndrives our commitment to becoming \"Inclusive by design. Everyone. Everywhere. All the time. Through the IDEA Framework, we aim to create a culture that values and respects the diversity of our community by integrating an intersectional lens to our practice. Specifically, our Framework is built on the following five pillars:\nAccess, Participation and Success\n: building the diversity of our student and staff profile, ensuring all can participate and thrive in learning.\nCulture, Capability and Leadership\n: recognising the critical roles that leaders at all levels play in setting the tone and modelling inclusion.\nEducation and Research\n: focusing on shifting pedagogical approaches to teaching and embedding diverse perspectives and experiences into curriculum and research.\nInfrastructure, Services and Operations\n: highlighting the importance of planning, resourcing, evaluation and communications, and the way in which these elements support inclusion, diversity, equity and access.\nCommunity and Partnerships\n: considering the way in which we can have a positive impact in the communities we serve, sharing our resources and expertise and learning from others.\nDigital Accessibility Procedure\nUnder the\nDisability Discrimination Act 1992\nand the\nDisability Standards for Education 2005\n, RMIT is required to provide information, services and course materials that are accessible to the widest possible audience. Our Digital Accessibility Procedure seeks to ensure our websites and systems are in line with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2.2 level AA.\nThe Procedure also sets out guidelines to ensure that accessibility is considered during the Procurement stage of new digital platforms and during the lifetime of our relationship with vendors.\nRead RMIT's Digital Accessibility Procedure\nAbout this website’s accessibility\nIn line with the\nDisability Discrimination Act 1992\nand our internal\nDigital Accessibility Procedure\n, we have taken reasonable steps to ensure the accessibility of this website. Some of the actions we have taken include:\nCreating a design system that includes accessibility guidelines for new and existing web components\nUsing a bug tracking system to track accessibility issues\nEmploying a monitoring tool that periodically scans our site in the background searching for accessibility issues\nProviding regular  professional development opportunities for content authors so that they produce accessible content\nTesting some of our web components with the following combinations of operating system and assistive technology: Windows 10 with Chrome and JAWS 2022; Windows 10 with Firefox and NVDA 2024; macOS 14 with VoiceOver; Android 14 with TalkBack; iOS 17 with VoiceOver\nNavigation features of this website\nThis website includes navigation features to make it easier for people with disabilities to explore it. Some common features across our pages include:\nAn invisible heading level 1 that matches the title of the page\nAn “Skip to content” link. This link is the first element to receive keyboard focus when navigating with the keyboard\nBreadcrumbs at the top of each page\nAbility to zoom into the content up to 400% without loss of content\nAll interactive elements have visible focus indicators\nSome links with “Find out more” as their text include an invisible label with the heading associated with them. So, if there is a heading that reads “Payments and Purchasing” with a “Find out more” link, the link will have an invisible label that reads “Find out more – Payments and Purchasing”\nImages are optimised to consume low bandwidth and load quickly on slow Internet connections\nConsistent header, navigation and footer sections\nLimitations of this site’s accessibility\nWhile we’ve done a lot to ensure this site is accessible, you may find some limitations:\nWe always aim to communicate clearly, and as simply as possible; however, some of our information may require a reasonable level of technical understanding due to its nature.\nWhile the site has been reviewed by accessibility experts, some of the website has not yet been fully user-tested with people with disabilities.\nSome of the third-party systems we rely on may not comply with WCAG 2.2 level AA.\nOur videos are not audio described. Some videos may be missing captions or a transcript.\nAssistive Technology supported at RMIT\nAssistive (or adaptive) technology refers to devices and software that make it possible for people with disabilities to use computers.\nExamples of assistive technology\nNVDA\nis a free screen-reading software that converts text on screen to voice. You can\ndownload NVDA for free\n.\nVoiceOver\nis the free screen-reading program included in all Apple computers. See\nApple’s VoiceOver user guide\n.\nZoom (magnification) software\n:\nWindows Magnifier\nand\nmacOS Zoom\ncan help you enlarge the content of your screen and are included by default in the operating system of your computer.\nRead&Write\nis a literacy assistance software. Everyone at RMIT can install this software. See the\ninstructions to install Read&Write (PDF 542 KB)\n.\nAccessibility settings on your computer and phone\n: modern operating systems include options such as: dark mode, focus mode, high contrast mode, colour filters for colour vision deficiency, blue light filters, and more! Explore the accessibility settings of your device and you’ll be surprised by the options that come built in.\nFor students,\nEquitable Learning Services\nmay be able to provide access to commercial assistive technology if this supports participation in your studies. Students can also check the\nLibrary computers and their assistive technology offering\n.\nStaff may contact\nIT Service Connect (login required)\nto find out more about support for assistive technology.\nPhysical Accessibility\nEach year Property Services works with the RMIT Accessibility Working Group and stakeholders from across the University, guided by the Accessibility Action Plan, to deliver improvements to the accessibility of our campus facilities to enhance the staff and student experience.\nRMIT aims to be an example of the positive change you can make to peoples’ lives by going beyond the minimum set by building standards and creating new environments that are truly inclusive by design.\nSensory friendly spaces\nSwanston Library has two rooms that are designed to reduce sensory overload, and provide a safe and quiet environment for study and self-regulation.\nSee the\nLibrary Accessibility and Neurodiversity support page\nto find out more about the conditions of use of these spaces.\nFind out more about accessibility and disability\nContact us if you experience difficulties with our website\nAt RMIT, we are constantly striving to improve our accessibility efforts. Please contact us at\ndigital-accessibility@rmit.edu.au\nto report any accessibility issues with our digital assets. We will do our best to find a solution with you.\nAlternatively, staff and students can create a ticket with\nIT Service Connect\nand describe where the problem occurred, what the problem was, what you were trying to do, and what computer and software you were using.\nRelated links\nDiversity and inclusion\nDigital Accessibility Procedure\nDigital accessibility\nRelated links\nDiversity and inclusion\nDigital Accessibility Procedure\nDigital accessibility\nAcknowledgement of Country\nRMIT University acknowledges the people of the Woi wurrung and Boon wurrung language groups of the eastern Kulin Nation on whose unceded lands we conduct the business of the University.
